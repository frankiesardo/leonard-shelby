[0:00] 100% of my code is written by quad code.
[0:02] I have not edited a single line by hand
[0:05] since November. Every day I ship 10, 20,
[0:07] 30 p requests. So at the moment I have
[0:09] like five agents running while we're
[0:11] recording this.
[0:11] >> Yeah. Yeah. Do you miss writing code?
[0:13] >> I have never enjoyed coding as much as I
[0:15] do today because I don't have to deal
[0:17] with all the minutia. Productivity per
[0:19] engineer has increased 200%.
[0:21] >> There's always this question, should I
[0:22] learn to code? In a year or two, it's
[0:23] not going to matter. Coding is largely
[0:24] solved. I imagine a world where everyone
[0:27] is able to program. Anyone can just
[0:28] build software anytime. What's the next
[0:30] big shift to how software is written?
[0:32] >> Quad is starting to come up with ideas.
[0:33] It's looking through feedback. It's
[0:35] looking at bug reports. It's looking at
[0:36] telemetry for bug fixes and things to
[0:38] ship a little more like a co-orker or
[0:40] something like that.
[0:41] >> A lot of people listening to this are
[0:42] product managers and they're probably
[0:44] sweating. I think by the end of the
[0:45] year, everyone's going to be a product
[0:46] manager and everyone codes. The title
[0:48] software engineer is going to start to
[0:49] go away. It's just going to be replaced
[0:50] by builder and it's going to be painful
[0:52] for a lot of people.
[0:56] Today my guest is Boris Churnney, head
[0:58] of Claude Code at Anthropic. It is hard
[1:01] to describe the impact that Claude Code
[1:03] has had on the world. Around the time
[1:05] this episode comes out will be the
[1:07] one-year anniversary of Claude Code. And
[1:09] in that short time, it has completely
[1:11] transformed the job of a software
[1:13] engineer and it is now starting to
[1:15] transform the jobs of many other
[1:17] functions in tech which we talk about.
[1:19] Cloud code itself is also a massive
[1:22] driver of anthropic overall growth over
[1:24] the past year. They just raised a round
[1:26] at over $350 billion. And as Boris
[1:29] mentions, the growth of Claude Code
[1:31] itself is still accelerating. Just in
[1:34] the past month, their daily active users
[1:35] has doubled. Boris is also just a really
[1:38] interesting, thoughtful, deepinking
[1:40] human. And during this conversation, we
[1:42] discover we were born in the same city
[1:44] in Ukraine. That is so funny. I had no
[1:47] idea. A huge thank you to Ben Man, Jenny
[1:49] Wen, and Mike Griger for suggesting
[1:51] topics for this conversation. Don't

[3:49] Boris, thank you so much for being here
[3:52] and welcome to the podcast.
[3:54] >> Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[3:55] >> I want to start with a a spicy question.
[3:58] About 6 months ago, I don't know if
[3:59] people even remember this, you actually
[4:01] left Anthropic. You joined Curser and
[4:05] then two weeks later, you went back to
[4:07] Anthropic. What happened there? I don't
[4:09] think I've ever heard the actual story.
[4:12] It's the fastest job change that I've
[4:13] ever had.
[4:17] Um, I joined Cursor because I'm a big
[4:19] fan of the product and honestly I met
[4:22] the team and I was just really
[4:23] impressed. Uh, they're an awesome team.
[4:25] Uh, I still I still think they're
[4:27] awesome and they're just building really
[4:28] cool stuff and kind of they they saw
[4:30] where AI coding was going I think before
[4:31] a lot of people did. So the idea of
[4:34] building good product was just very
[4:35] exciting for me. I think as soon as I
[4:38] got there, what I started to realize is
[4:40] what I really missed about Ant was the
[4:42] mission. And that's actually what
[4:44] originally drove me to Ant also cuz uh
[4:48] but before I joined Anthropic, I was,
[4:49] you know, I was working in big tech and
[4:50] then I was at some point I wanted to
[4:52] work at a at a lab to just help shape
[4:55] the future of this crazy thing that that
[4:58] we're building in some way. And the
[5:00] thing that drew me to anthropic was the
[5:01] mission. And it was, you know, it's all
[5:02] about safety. And when you talk to
[5:04] people at Enthropic, just like find
[5:06] someone in the hallway, if you ask them
[5:08] why they're here, the answer is always
[5:10] going to be safety. Um, and so this kind
[5:13] of like missiondrivenness just really
[5:14] really resonated with me. And I just
[5:16] know personally it's something I need in
[5:18] order to be happy. Um, and I that's just
[5:22] a thing that I really missed. And I
[5:23] found that, you know, whatever the work
[5:25] might be, no matter how exciting, even
[5:27] if it's building a really cool product,
[5:28] it's just not really a substitute for
[5:29] that. Um, so for me it was actually u it
[5:33] was pretty obvious that that I was
[5:34] missing that pretty quick.
[5:35] >> Okay. So let me follow the thread of
[5:37] just coming back to anthropic and the
[5:39] work you've done there. This podcast is
[5:41] going to come out around the year
[5:42] anniversary of launching cloud code. So
[5:45] I'm going to spend a little time just
[5:46] reflecting on the impact that you've
[5:49] had. There's um this report that
[5:51] recently came out that I'm sure you saw
[5:53] by semi analysis that showed that 4% of
[5:55] all GitHub commits are authored by cloud
[5:58] code now. and they predicted it'll be a
[6:00] fifth of all code commits on GitHub by
[6:03] the end of the year. The way they put it
[6:05] is while we blinked, AI consumed all
[6:07] software development.
[6:10] The day that we're recording this,
[6:11] Spotify just put out this uh headline
[6:13] that their best developers haven't
[6:14] written a line of code since December
[6:17] thanks to AI. More and more of the most
[6:20] advanced senior engineers, including
[6:22] you, are sharing the fact that you don't
[6:24] write code anymore, that it's all AI
[6:26] generated. and many aren't even looking
[6:28] at code anymore is how far we've gotten
[6:31] in large part thanks to this little
[6:33] project that you started and that your
[6:34] team has scaled over the past year. I'm
[6:37] curious just to hear your reflections on
[6:39] on this past year and the impact that
[6:41] your work has had. These numbers are
[6:43] just totally crazy, right? Like four 4%
[6:45] of all commits in the world is just way
[6:48] more than I imagined and like like you
[6:49] said, it still feels like the starting
[6:51] point. Um these are also just public
[6:53] commits. So we actually think if you
[6:54] look at private repositories, it's quite
[6:56] a bit higher than that. And I I think
[6:58] the craziest thing for me isn't even the
[6:59] number that we're at right now, but the
[7:02] pace at which we're growing because if
[7:04] you look at Quad Code's growth rate kind
[7:05] of across any metric, it's continuing to
[7:07] accelerate. Um so it's not just going
[7:09] up, it's going up faster and faster.
[7:12] When I first started Quad Code, it was
[7:13] just going to be a like it was just
[7:16] supposed to be a little hack. Um you
[7:18] know we we broadly knew at Enthropic
[7:20] that we wanted to get a we wanted to
[7:22] ship some kind of coding product and you
[7:24] know for enthropic for a long time we
[7:26] were building the models in this way
[7:28] that kind of fit our mental model of the
[7:30] way that we build safe hi where the
[7:32] model starts by being really good at
[7:34] coding then it gets really good at tool
[7:35] use then it gets really good at computer
[7:37] use roughly this is like the trajectory
[7:40] uh and you know we've been working on
[7:41] this for a long time and when you look
[7:44] at the team that I started on it was
[7:46] called the anthropic labs team uh and
[7:47] actually Mike Kger and you know Ben man
[7:49] they just kicked this team off again uh
[7:51] for kind of round two the team built
[7:54] some pretty cool stuff so we built quad
[7:55] code we built MCP we built the desktop
[7:57] app so you can kind of see the seeds of
[7:59] this idea you know like it's coding then
[8:01] it's tool use then it's computer use and
[8:04] the reason this matters for anthropic is
[8:06] uh because of safety it's kind of again
[8:09] just back to that AI is getting more and
[8:11] more powerful it's getting more and more
[8:12] capable the thing that's happened in the
[8:14] last year is that for at least For
[8:16] engineers, the AI doesn't just write the
[8:18] code. It it's not just a conversation
[8:20] partner, but it actually uses tools. It
[8:22] acts in the world. Um, and I think now
[8:24] with co-work, we're starting to see the
[8:25] transition for non-technical folks also.
[8:28] Um, for a lot of people that use
[8:30] conversational AI, this might be the
[8:32] first time that they're using the thing
[8:34] that actually acts. It can actually use
[8:35] your Gmail, it can use your Slack, it
[8:37] can do all these things for you and it's
[8:38] quite good at it. Um, and it's only
[8:40] going to get better from here. So I
[8:42] think for anthropic for a long time
[8:44] there was this feeling that we wanted to
[8:45] build something but it wasn't obvious
[8:46] what and so uh when I joined ant I spent
[8:50] one month kind of hacking and you know
[8:52] built a bunch of like weird prototypes
[8:53] most of them didn't ship and you know
[8:55] weren't even close to shipping it was
[8:56] just kind of understanding the
[8:57] boundaries of what the model can do then
[8:59] I spent a month doing post- training um
[9:02] so to understand kind of the research
[9:03] side of it and I think honestly that's
[9:05] just for me as an engineer I find that
[9:08] to do good work you really have to
[9:09] understand the layer under the layer at
[9:11] which you work. And with traditional
[9:14] engineering work, you know, if you're
[9:15] working on product, you want to
[9:17] understand the infrastructure, the
[9:18] runtime, the virtual machine, the
[9:20] language kind of whatever that is, the
[9:21] system that you're building on. But, uh,
[9:24] yeah, if you're like if you're working
[9:25] in AI, you just really have to
[9:26] understand the model to some degree to
[9:28] to do good work. So, I took a little
[9:31] detour to do that and then I came back
[9:32] and just started prototyping what
[9:34] eventually became quad code. Uh, and the
[9:37] very first version of it, I I have like
[9:39] a there's like a video recording of the
[9:40] summer because I recorded this demo and
[9:42] I posted it. It was called QuadCLI back
[9:44] then. And I just kind of showed off how
[9:46] it used a few tools and the shocking
[9:48] thing for me was that I gave it a batch
[9:50] tool and uh it just was able to use that
[9:53] to write code to tell me what music I'm
[9:56] listening to when I asked it like what
[9:57] music am I listening to? And this is the
[10:00] craziest thing, right? cuz it's like
[10:02] there's no we I I didn't instruct the
[10:04] model to say, you know, use, you know,
[10:06] this tool for this or kind of do
[10:08] whatever. The model was given this tool
[10:09] and I figured out how to use it to
[10:11] answer this question that I had that I
[10:12] wasn't even sure if it could answer.
[10:14] What music am I listening to?
[10:16] And so I I I started prototyping this a
[10:19] little bit more. Um I made a post about
[10:21] it and I announced it internally and it
[10:23] got two likes. That's the that was that
[10:27] was the extent of the reaction at the
[10:28] time because I think people internally
[10:30] you know like when you think of coding
[10:31] tools you think of like you think of IDE
[10:33] you think about kind of all these pretty
[10:34] sophisticated environments no one
[10:37] thought that this thing could be
[10:38] terminal based um that's sort of a weird
[10:40] way to design it and that wasn't really
[10:42] the intention but uh you know from the
[10:44] start I built it in a terminal because
[10:47] you know for the first couple months it
[10:48] was just me so it was just the easiest
[10:50] way to build uh and for me this is
[10:52] actually a pretty important product
[10:53] lesson right is like you want to
[10:55] underresource things a little bit at the
[10:57] start. Then we started thinking about
[11:00] what other form factors we should build
[11:02] and we actually decided to stick with
[11:04] the terminal for a while and the biggest
[11:06] reason was the model is improving so
[11:08] quickly. We felt that there wasn't
[11:10] really another form factor that could
[11:12] keep up with it. And honestly this was
[11:14] just me kind of like struggling with
[11:16] kind of like what should we build you
[11:17] know like for the last year quad code
[11:19] has just been all I think about. And so
[11:21] just like late at night, this is just
[11:22] something I was thinking about like,
[11:23] okay, the model is continuing to
[11:24] improve. What do we do? How can we
[11:26] possibly keep up? And the terminal was
[11:28] honestly just the only idea that I had.
[11:31] And uh yeah, it ended up catching on
[11:33] after after I released it pretty
[11:36] quickly. It became a hit at Anthropic
[11:38] and you know, the the daily active users
[11:40] just went vertical. And really early on,
[11:42] actually before I launched it, Ben man
[11:44] uh nudged me to make a DAU chart and I
[11:46] was like, you know, it's like kind of
[11:47] early maybe, you know, should we really
[11:49] do it right now? and he was like,
[11:50] "Yeah." And so the the chart just went
[11:52] vertical pretty immediately. Uh and then
[11:55] in February, we released it externally.
[11:57] Actually, something that people don't
[11:58] really remember is Quad Code was not
[12:01] initially a hit when we released it. It
[12:04] it got a bunch of users. There was a lot
[12:06] of early adopters that got it
[12:07] immediately, but it actually took many
[12:09] months for everyone to really understand
[12:11] what this thing is. Just again, it's
[12:13] like it's just so different. And when I
[12:15] think about it, kind of part of the
[12:17] reason quad code works is this idea of
[12:19] latent demand where we bring the tool to
[12:21] where people are and it makes existing
[12:23] workflows a little bit easier, but also
[12:25] because it's it's in a terminal. It's
[12:26] like a little surprising. It's a little
[12:28] alien in this way. So you have to you
[12:29] have to kind of be open-minded and you
[12:31] had to learn to use it. And of course
[12:33] now you know quad code is available you
[12:35] know in the iOS and Android quad app.
[12:38] It's available in the desktop app. It's
[12:39] available on the website. It's available
[12:41] as IDE extensions in Slack and GitHub.
[12:43] you know all these places where
[12:44] engineers are it's a little more
[12:46] familiar but that wasn't the starting
[12:47] point
[12:49] so yeah I mean at the beginning it was
[12:51] kind of a surprise that this thing was
[12:53] even useful and uh you know as the team
[12:57] grew as the product grew as it started
[13:00] to become more and more useful to people
[13:02] just people around the world from you
[13:03] know small startups to the biggest fang
[13:05] companies started using it and they
[13:07] started giving feedback and I think just
[13:10] reflecting back it's been such a
[13:11] humbling experience cuz we just we keep
[13:14] learning from our users and just the
[13:16] most exciting thing is like you know
[13:18] none of us really know what we're doing.
[13:19] Um and we're just trying to figure out
[13:21] along with everyone else and the single
[13:23] best signal for that is just feedback
[13:24] from users. Um so that's just been the
[13:27] best I' I've been surprised so many
[13:28] times. It's incredible how fast
[13:31] something can change in today's world.
[13:33] You launched this a year ago and it
[13:35] wasn't the first time people could use
[13:36] AI to code but uh in a year the entire
[13:40] profession of software engineering has
[13:42] dramatically changed like there's all
[13:44] these predictions oh AI is going to be
[13:46] written 100% AI's code is going to be
[13:48] written by AI everyone's like no that's
[13:50] crazy what are you talking about now
[13:51] it's like
[13:52] >> of course it's happening exactly as they
[13:53] said it's just so things move so fast
[13:55] and change so fast now
[13:58] >> yeah it's really fast back at uh back at
[13:59] code with quad back in May that was like
[14:01] our first uh you know like developer
[14:03] conference that we did as Enthropic. Um
[14:06] I did a short talk and in the Q&amp;A after
[14:08] the talk people were asking what are
[14:10] your predictions for the end of the year
[14:12] and my prediction back in May of 2025
[14:14] was by the end of the year you might not
[14:16] need an ID to code anymore and we're
[14:18] going to start to see engineers not
[14:19] doing this and I remember the room like
[14:21] audibly gasped. It was such a crazy
[14:23] prediction but I think like at anthropic
[14:26] like this is just the way the way we
[14:27] think about things is exponentials and
[14:30] this is like very deep in the DNA. Like
[14:31] if you look at our co-founders like
[14:33] three of them were the first three
[14:34] authors on the scaling laws paper. Um so
[14:37] we really just think in exponentials and
[14:40] if you kind of look at the exponential
[14:41] of the percent of code that was written
[14:43] by quad at that point if you just trace
[14:44] the line it's pretty obvious we're going
[14:46] to cross 100% by the end of the year
[14:48] even if it just does not match intuition
[14:50] at all. Um, and so all I did was trace
[14:52] the line and yeah, in November that, you
[14:55] know, that happened for me personally
[14:56] and that's been the case since and we're
[14:58] starting to see that for a lot of
[15:00] different customers too. I thought was
[15:01] really interesting what you just shared
[15:02] there about kind of the journey is this
[15:04] kind of idea of just playing around and
[15:07] seeing what happens. This came up comes
[15:09] up with open claw a lot just like Peter
[15:10] was playing around and just like a thing
[15:12] happen. And it feels like that's a
[15:14] central kind of ingredient to a lot of
[15:15] the biggest innovations in AI is people
[15:17] just sitting around trying stuff to
[15:19] pushing the models further than most
[15:21] other people.
[15:21] >> I mean this the thing about innovation
[15:23] right like you can't uh you can't force
[15:24] it. There's no road map for innovation.
[15:26] Um you just have to give people space.
[15:28] You have to give them maybe the word is
[15:30] like safety. So it's like psychological
[15:32] safety that it's okay to fail. It's okay
[15:34] if 80% of the ideas are bad. Um you also
[15:36] have to hold them accountable a bit. So
[15:38] if the idea is bad, you you know you cut
[15:39] your losses, move on to the next idea
[15:41] instead of investing more. Uh in the
[15:44] early days of quad code, I had no idea
[15:45] that this thing would be useful at all.
[15:47] Cuz even in February when we released
[15:50] it, it was writing maybe I don't know
[15:51] like 20% of my code, not more. And even
[15:54] in May, it was writing maybe 30%. I was
[15:56] still using you know curtzer for most of
[15:57] my code. And it only crossed 100% in
[16:00] November. So it took a while. But even
[16:02] from the earliest day, it just felt like
[16:03] I was on to something. And I was just
[16:05] spending like every night, every weekend
[16:07] hockey on this. And luckily my, you
[16:08] know, my wife was very supportive. Um,
[16:11] but it it just felt like it was on to
[16:13] something. It wasn't obvious what. And
[16:14] and sometimes, you know, you find a
[16:16] thread, you just have to pull on it.
[16:17] >> So at this point, 100% of your code is
[16:19] written by cloud code. Is that is that
[16:21] kind of the current state of your
[16:22] coding?
[16:23] >> Yeah. So 100% of my code is written by
[16:25] cloud code. Um, I am a fairly prolific
[16:28] coder. Um, and this has been the case
[16:30] even when I worked back at Instagram. I
[16:31] was like one of the top few most
[16:33] productive engineers. Um and that's
[16:35] actually that's still the case uh here
[16:37] at Anthropic.
[16:38] >> Wow. Even as head of head of the team.
[16:41] >> Yeah. Yeah. Do still do a lot of coding.
[16:43] Um and so every you know every day I
[16:45] ship like 10 20 30 p requests something
[16:47] like that
[16:47] >> every day.
[16:49] >> Every day. Yeah.
[16:50] >> Good god.
[16:50] >> Uh 100% written by quad code. I have not
[16:53] edited a single line by hand since uh
[16:57] November.
[16:59] And yeah, that that's been it. I do look
[17:02] at the code. So I I don't think we're
[17:04] kind of at the point yet where you can
[17:06] be totally hands-off, especially when
[17:07] there's a lot of people, you know, like
[17:08] running the program. You have to make
[17:09] sure that it's correct. You have to make
[17:11] sure it's safe and so on. Um, and then
[17:13] we also have Quad doing automatic code
[17:15] review for everything. Um, so here at
[17:16] Enthropic, Quad reviews 100% of poll
[17:19] requests. Um, there's still layer of
[17:20] like human review after it, but you kind
[17:22] of like you still do want some of these
[17:24] checkpoints like you still want a human
[17:25] looking at the code. um unless it's like
[17:27] pure prototype code that you know it's
[17:29] not going to run it's not going to run
[17:31] anywhere it's just a prototype.
[17:32] >> What's kind of the next frontier? So at
[17:34] this point 100% of your code is being
[17:37] written by AI. This is clearly where
[17:39] everyone is going in software
[17:41] engineering. That felt like a crazy
[17:43] milestone. Now it's just like of course
[17:45] this is the world now. What's what's
[17:48] kind of the next big shift to how
[17:50] software is written that either your
[17:51] team's already operating in or you think
[17:52] will head towards? I think something
[17:55] that's happening right now is Quad is
[17:56] starting to come up with ideas. Um so
[17:59] Quad is looking through feedback. It's
[18:01] uh looking at bug reports. It's looking
[18:03] at um you know like telemetry and and
[18:05] things like this and it's starting to
[18:06] come up with ideas for bug fixes and
[18:08] things to ship. So it's just starting to
[18:11] get a little more um you know like a
[18:14] little more like a co-orker or something
[18:15] like that. I think the second thing is
[18:17] we're starting to branch out of coding a
[18:18] little bit. So I think at this point
[18:20] it's safe to say that coding is largely
[18:22] solved. At least for the kind of
[18:24] programming that I do, it's just a
[18:25] solved problem because quad can do it.
[18:27] And so now we're starting to think about
[18:28] okay like what's next? What's beyond
[18:30] this? There's a lot of things that are
[18:32] kind of adjacent to coding. Um and I
[18:34] think this is going to be coming. But
[18:36] also just you know general tasks, you
[18:38] know, like I use co-work every day now
[18:40] to do all sorts of things that are just
[18:42] not related to coding at all and just to
[18:43] do it automatically. Like for example, I
[18:45] had to pay a parking ticket the other
[18:46] day. I just had co-work do it. um all of
[18:49] my project management for the team uh
[18:51] co-work does all of it. It's like
[18:52] syncing stuff between spreadsheets and
[18:54] messaging people on Slack and email and
[18:56] all this kind of stuff. So I think the
[18:59] frontier is something like this and I I
[19:02] don't think it's coding because I think
[19:03] coding is you know it's pretty much
[19:05] solved and over the next few months I
[19:07] think what we're going to see is just
[19:08] across the industry it's going to become
[19:09] increasingly solved you know for every
[19:11] kind of codebase every tech stack that
[19:13] people work on.
[19:14] >> This idea of helping you come up with
[19:16] what to work on is so interesting. A lot
[19:17] of people listening to this are product
[19:19] managers and they're probably sweating.
[19:22] How do you use Claude for this? Do you
[19:24] just talk to it? Is there anything
[19:26] clever you've come up with to help you
[19:28] use it to come up with what to build?
[19:29] >> Honestly, the simplest thing is like
[19:31] open quad code or co-work and point it
[19:33] at a Slack thread. Um, you know, like
[19:35] for us, we have this channel that that's
[19:37] all the internal feedback about Quad
[19:38] Code. Since we first released it, even
[19:41] in like 2024 internally, it's just been
[19:44] this fire hose of feedback. Um, and it's
[19:46] the best. And like in the early days,
[19:47] what I would do is anytime that someone
[19:49] sends feedback, I would just go in and I
[19:51] would fix every single thing as fast as
[19:53] I possibly could. So like within a
[19:55] minute, within 5 minutes or whatever.
[19:56] And this just really fast feedback
[19:58] cycle, it encourages people to give more
[19:59] and more feedback. It's just so
[20:01] important cuz it makes them feel heard
[20:03] cuz you know like usually when you use a
[20:05] product, you give feedback, it just goes
[20:06] into a black hole somewhere and then you
[20:07] don't give feedback again. So if you
[20:09] make people feel heard, then they want
[20:10] to contribute and they want to help make
[20:12] the thing better. Um, and so now I kind
[20:14] of do the same thing, but Quad honestly
[20:16] does a lot of the work. So I pointed at
[20:18] the channel and it's like, "Okay, here's
[20:20] a few things that I can do. I just put
[20:22] up a couple PRs. Want to take a look at
[20:24] that one?" I'm like, "Yeah." Have you
[20:25] noticed that it is getting much better
[20:27] at this? Because this is kind of the
[20:28] holy grail, right? Now it's like, "Cool,
[20:30] building solved." Code review became
[20:32] kind of the next bottleneck. All these
[20:34] PRs, who's going to review them all? The
[20:36] next big open question is just like,
[20:37] okay, now we need to now now humans are
[20:40] necessary for figuring out what to
[20:41] build, what to prioritize. And you're
[20:42] saying that that's where claude code is
[20:44] starting to help you. Has it has it
[20:45] gotten a lot better with like say Opus
[20:47] 46 or what's been the trajectory there?
[20:50] >> Yeah. Yeah, it's improved a lot. Um I
[20:52] think some of it is kind of like
[20:54] training that we do specific to coding.
[20:56] Um so you know obviously you know best
[20:58] coding model in the world and you know
[21:00] it's getting better and better like 4.6
[21:02] is just incredible but also actually a
[21:04] lot of the training that we do outside
[21:05] of coding translates pretty well too. So
[21:07] there is this kind of like transfer
[21:09] where you teach the model to do you know
[21:10] X and it kind of gets better at Y. Um
[21:14] yeah and the the gains have just been
[21:16] insane like at anthropic over the last
[21:18] year like since we introduced quad code
[21:20] we probably I don't know the exact
[21:22] number we probably like 4x the
[21:23] engineering team or something like this
[21:25] but productivity per engineer has
[21:27] increased 200%.
[21:29] in terms of like pull requests and like
[21:31] this number is just crazy for anyone
[21:33] that actually works in the space and
[21:34] works on deaf productivity because back
[21:36] in a previous life I was at Meta and you
[21:38] know one of my responsibilities was code
[21:39] quality for the company. So this is like
[21:41] the all of our code bases that was my
[21:43] responsibility like Facebook, Instagram,
[21:45] WhatsApp all this stuff. Um and a lot of
[21:47] that was about productivity because if
[21:49] you make the code higher quality then
[21:51] engineers are more productive and things
[21:53] that we saw is you know in a year with
[21:56] hundreds of engineers working on it you
[21:57] would see a gain of like a few
[21:58] percentage points of productivity
[22:00] something like this. Um and so nowadays
[22:02] seeing these gains of just hundreds of
[22:03] percentage points it's is just
[22:05] absolutely insane. What's also insane is
[22:07] just how normalized this has all been
[22:08] like we hear these numbers like of
[22:10] course AI is doing this to us. It's just
[22:12] it's so unprecedented the amount of
[22:14] change that is happening to software
[22:17] development to building products to just
[22:18] this the world of tech. It's just like
[22:20] so easy to get used to it. But it's
[22:22] important to recognize this is crazy.
[22:25] This is something like I have to remind
[22:27] myself once in a while. There's sort of
[22:28] like a downside of this because the
[22:30] model changes so well there's actually
[22:32] like there's many kind of downsides that
[22:33] that we could talk about but I think one
[22:35] of them on a personal level is the model
[22:37] changes so often that I sometimes get
[22:40] stuck in this like old way of of
[22:42] thinking about it and I even find that
[22:45] like new people on the team or even new
[22:46] grads that join do stuff in a more kind
[22:50] of like AGI forward way than I do. So
[22:53] like sometimes for example I I I had
[22:55] this case like a couple months ago where
[22:56] there was a memory leak and so like what
[22:58] this is is you know like quad code the
[23:00] memory usage is going up and at some
[23:01] point it crashes. This is like a very
[23:03] common kind of engineering problem that
[23:05] you know every engineer has debugged a
[23:06] thousand times and traditionally the way
[23:08] that you do it is you take a heap
[23:10] snapshot you put it into a special
[23:12] debugger you kind of figure out what's
[23:13] going on you know use these special
[23:15] tools to see what's happening. Um, and I
[23:18] was doing this and I was kind of like
[23:19] looking through these traces and trying
[23:20] to figure out what was going on. And the
[23:22] engineer that was newer on the team just
[23:25] uh had Quad Code do it and was like,
[23:27] "Hey Quad, it seems like there's a leak.
[23:28] Can you figure it out?" And so like Quad
[23:30] Code did exactly the same thing that I
[23:31] was doing. It it took the heap snapshot.
[23:33] It wrote a little tool for itself so it
[23:35] can kind of like analyze it itself. Um,
[23:37] it was sort of like a just in time
[23:39] program. Uh, and it found the issue and
[23:41] put up a pull request faster than I
[23:42] could. So it's it's something where like
[23:45] for those of us that have been using the
[23:47] model for a long time, you still have to
[23:49] kind of transport yourself to the
[23:51] current moment and not get stuck back in
[23:54] an old model because it's not sonnet 3.5
[23:56] anymore. The new models are just
[23:57] completely completely different. Uh and
[24:00] just this this mindset shift is is very
[24:02] different. I hear you have these very
[24:04] specific principles that you've codified
[24:06] for your team that when people join you
[24:09] you kind of walk them through them. I
[24:11] believe one of them is what's better
[24:12] than doing something having Claude do
[24:14] it. And it feels like that's exactly
[24:15] what you describe with this memory leak
[24:17] is just like you almost forgot that
[24:18] principle of like okay let me see if
[24:20] Claude can solve this for me. There's
[24:22] this uh there's this interesting thing
[24:23] that happens also when you um when you
[24:26] underfund everything a little bit uh
[24:28] because then people are kind of forced
[24:29] to clify and this is something that we
[24:32] see. So you know for work where
[24:33] sometimes we just put like one engineer
[24:35] on a project and the way that they're
[24:38] able to ship really quickly because they
[24:40] want to ship quickly. This is like an
[24:41] intrinsic motivation that comes from
[24:42] within is just wanting to do a good job.
[24:44] One if you have a good idea you just
[24:45] really want to get it out there. No one
[24:47] has to force you to do that. That comes
[24:48] from you. Um and and so if you have
[24:51] claude, you can just use that to
[24:52] automate a lot of work. Uh and that
[24:55] that's kind of what we see over and
[24:56] over. So I think that's kind of like one
[24:58] principle is underfunding things a
[25:00] little bit. I think another principle is
[25:02] just encouraging people to go faster. So
[25:04] if you can do something today, you
[25:06] should just do it today. And this is
[25:08] something we we really really encourage
[25:10] on the team. Early on it was really
[25:12] important because it was just me and so
[25:14] our only advantage was speed.
[25:17] that's the only way that we could ship a
[25:18] product that would compete in this very
[25:19] crowded coding market. But nowadays,
[25:21] it's still very much a principle we have
[25:23] on the team. And if you want to go
[25:25] faster, a really good way to do that is
[25:28] to just have Claude do more stuff. Um,
[25:30] so he it just very much encourages that.
[25:32] This idea of underfunding, it's so
[25:34] interesting because in general there's
[25:36] this feeling like AI is going to allow
[25:38] you to not have as many employees, not
[25:40] have as many engineers. And so it's not
[25:42] only you can be more productive. What
[25:43] you're saying is that you will actually
[25:45] do better if you underfund. It's not
[25:47] just that AI can make you faster. It's
[25:49] you will get more out of the AI tooling
[25:51] if you have fewer people working on
[25:53] something. Yeah. If you if you hire
[25:56] great engineers, they'll figure out how
[25:57] to do it. And uh especially if you
[25:59] empower them to do it. This is something
[26:00] I actually talk talk a lot about with uh
[26:03] you know with like CTO's and kind of all
[26:04] sorts of companies. My advice generally
[26:07] is don't try to optimize. Don't don't
[26:09] try to cost cut at the beginning. Start
[26:11] by just giving engineers as many tokens
[26:13] as possible. And now now you're starting
[26:15] to see companies like you know at
[26:16] Anthropic we have you know everyone can
[26:17] use a lot of tokens. We're starting to
[26:19] see this come up as like a perk at some
[26:21] companies. Like if you join you get
[26:23] unlimited tokens. This is a thing I very
[26:25] much encourage because um it makes
[26:29] people free to try these ideas that
[26:31] would have been too crazy and then if
[26:33] there's an idea that works then you can
[26:36] figure out how to scale it and that's
[26:37] the point to kind of optimize and to
[26:38] cost cut figure out like you know maybe
[26:40] you can do it with haiku or with sonnet
[26:42] instead of opus or whatever but at the
[26:44] beginning you just want to throw a lot
[26:45] of tokens at it and see if the idea
[26:47] works and give engineers the freedom to
[26:48] do that. So the advice here is uh just
[26:51] be be loose with your tokens with this
[26:53] the cost on on using these models.
[26:55] People hearing this may be like of
[26:57] course he works at Anthropic. He wants
[26:58] us to use as many tokens as possible.
[27:00] But you're what you're saying here is
[27:02] the the most interesting innovative
[27:03] ideas will come out of someone just kind
[27:05] of taking it to the max and seeing
[27:06] what's possible.
[27:08] >> Yeah. And I and I think the reality is
[27:09] like at small scale like you know you're
[27:11] not going to get like a giant bill or
[27:12] anything like this. Like if it's an
[27:14] individual engineer experimenting, it's
[27:16] the token cost is still probably
[27:18] relatively low relative to their salary
[27:21] or you know other costs of running the
[27:23] business. So it it's actually like not
[27:25] not a huge cost as the thing scales up.
[27:28] So like let's say you know they build
[27:29] something awesome and then it takes a
[27:31] huge amount of tokens and then the cost
[27:33] becomes pretty big. That's the point at
[27:34] which you want to optimize it. But don't
[27:36] don't do that too early.
[27:37] >> Have you seen companies where their uh
[27:39] token cost is higher than their salary?
[27:41] Is that a trend you think we're going to
[27:43] find and see?
[27:44] >> You know, at Anthropic, we're starting
[27:45] to see some engineers that are spending,
[27:47] you know, like hundreds of thousands a
[27:48] month in in tokens. Um, so we're
[27:51] starting to see this a little bit. Um,
[27:53] there's some companies that are we're
[27:54] starting to see similar things. Yeah.
[27:58] >> Going back to coding, do you miss
[28:00] writing code? Is this something you're
[28:02] kind of sad about that this is no longer
[28:04] a thing you will do as a software
[28:05] engineer? It's funny for me, you know,
[28:07] like when when I learned engineering,
[28:10] for me it was very practical. I learned
[28:13] engineering so I could build stuff
[28:16] and for me I was I was selftaught, you
[28:17] know, like I studied economics in
[28:19] school, but um I didn't study CS, but I
[28:22] I taught myself engineering kind of
[28:24] early on. I was programming in like
[28:25] middle school and from the very
[28:27] beginning it was very practical. So I
[28:29] actually like I learned to code so that
[28:30] I can cheat on a math test. That was
[28:32] like the first thing we had these like
[28:34] graphing calculators and you know I just
[28:36] programmed the answer into
[28:37] >> TI83.
[28:38] >> T83 plus. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[28:41] >> Plus. Yeah. So like I programmed the
[28:42] answers in and then the next like math
[28:45] test whatever like the next year that it
[28:47] was just like too hard. Like I couldn't
[28:48] program all the answers in because I
[28:49] didn't know what the questions were. And
[28:50] so I had to write like a little solver
[28:52] so that it it was a program that would
[28:54] just like solve these like uh you know
[28:56] these al algebra questions or whatever.
[28:58] And then I figured out you can get a
[28:59] little cable, you can give the program
[29:01] to the rest of the class and then the
[29:02] whole class gets A's. But then we all
[29:04] got caught and the teacher told us to
[29:05] knock it off. But from the very
[29:07] beginning it's it's always just been
[29:08] very practical for me where programming
[29:11] is a way to build a thing. It's not the
[29:14] end in itself.
[29:16] At some point I personally fell into the
[29:18] rabbit hole of kind of like the the
[29:20] beauty of of programming. Um so like I I
[29:23] wrote a book about TypeScript. Um, I
[29:25] started the actually at the time it was
[29:27] the world's biggest uh, TypeScript
[29:28] meetup just because I fell in love with
[29:30] the language itself. Uh, and I kind of
[29:32] got in deep into like functional
[29:34] programming and and all this stuff. I
[29:36] think a lot of coders they get
[29:38] distracted by this. For me, it was
[29:41] always sort of um they there is a beauty
[29:44] to programming and especially to
[29:45] functional programming. There's a beauty
[29:47] to type systems. Um, there there's a
[29:49] certain kind of like this like buzz that
[29:51] you get like when you solve like a
[29:52] really a really complicated uh math
[29:55] problem. It's kind of similar when you
[29:57] kind of balance the types or you know
[29:58] the program is just like really
[30:00] beautiful but it's really not the end of
[30:02] it. Um I think for me coding is very
[30:04] much a tool and it's a way to do things.
[30:07] Uh that said not everyone feels this
[30:09] way. So for example you know like
[30:10] there's one engineer uh on the team Lena
[30:13] who you know was still writing C++ on
[30:15] the weekends by hand because you know
[30:17] for her she just really enjoys writing
[30:18] C++ by hand. And so everyone is
[30:21] different and I think even as this field
[30:23] changes, even as everything changes,
[30:26] there's always space to do this, there's
[30:28] always space to enjoy the art um and to
[30:30] and and to kind of do do things by hand
[30:33] uh if you want.
[30:34] >> Do you worry about your skills atrophing
[30:36] as an engineer? Is that something you
[30:38] worry about or is it just like, you
[30:39] know, this is just the way it's going to
[30:41] go?
[30:41] >> I think it's just the way that that it
[30:42] happens. I I don't worry about it too
[30:44] much personally. I think for me like
[30:46] programming is on is on a continuum and
[30:49] you know like way back in the day you
[30:50] know like software actually is like
[30:52] relatively new right like if you look at
[30:54] the way programs are written today like
[30:56] using software that's running on a
[30:57] virtual machine or something this has
[30:59] been the way that we've been writing
[31:00] programs since probably the 1960s so you
[31:03] know it's been you know like 60 years or
[31:05] something like that. Before that it was
[31:07] punch cards. Before that it was
[31:08] switches. Before that it was hardware.
[31:09] And before that it was just you know
[31:11] like literally pen and paper. It was
[31:12] like a room a room full of people that
[31:13] were doing math on on paper. And so, you
[31:17] know, programming has always changed in
[31:18] this way. In some ways, you still want
[31:21] to understand the layer under the layer
[31:23] because it helps you be a better
[31:24] engineer. And I think this will be the
[31:25] case maybe for the next year or so. Um,
[31:27] but I think pretty soon it just won't
[31:29] really matter. It's just going to be
[31:30] kind of like the the assembly code wring
[31:33] running under the programmer or
[31:34] something like this.
[31:36] uh at an emotional level, you know, I I
[31:40] feel like I've always had to learn new
[31:41] things. And as a programmer, it's
[31:44] actually not it doesn't feel that new
[31:45] because there's always new frameworks,
[31:46] there's always new languages. It's just
[31:48] something that we're quite comfortable
[31:49] with in the field. But at the same time,
[31:51] I you know, this isn't true for
[31:52] everyone. And I think for some people,
[31:54] they're going to feel a greater sense
[31:55] of, I don't know, maybe like loss or
[31:58] nostalgia or atrophy or something like
[32:00] this. I don't know if you saw this, but
[32:02] Elon was saying that uh why isn't the AI
[32:05] just writing binary straight to binary?
[32:07] Uh because what's the point of all this,
[32:09] you know, programming abstraction in the
[32:11] end?
[32:12] >> Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, it
[32:13] totally can do that if you wanted to.
[32:15] >> Oh, man. So, what I'm hearing here is in
[32:18] terms there's always this question,
[32:19] should I learn to code? Should people in
[32:20] school learn to code? Uh what I heard
[32:22] from you is your take is in like a year
[32:25] or two, you don't really need to. My
[32:27] take is I think for for people that are
[32:30] using um there that are using quad code
[32:33] that are using agents to code today you
[32:35] still have to understand the layer under
[32:37] but yeah in a year or two it's not going
[32:38] to matter. I I was thinking about um
[32:42] what is the right like historical analog
[32:44] for this cuz like like somehow we have
[32:47] to situate this thing in history and and
[32:49] kind of figure out when have we gone
[32:51] through similar transitions. What's the
[32:52] right kind of mental model for this? I
[32:54] think the thing that's come closest for
[32:56] me is the printing press. And so you
[32:59] know if you look at Europe in uh you
[33:01] know like in the in the mid the mid400s
[33:04] literacy was actually very low. Uh there
[33:06] was sub 1% of the population it was
[33:08] scribes that uh you know they were the
[33:11] ones that did all the writing. They they
[33:12] were the ones that did all the reading.
[33:14] They were employed by like lords and
[33:15] kings that often were not literate
[33:17] themselves. And so you know it was their
[33:19] job of this very tiny percent of the
[33:20] population to do this. And at some point
[33:23] the you know Gutenberg and and the
[33:24] printing press came along and there was
[33:27] this crazy stat that in the 50 years
[33:29] after the printing press was uh built
[33:32] there was more printed material created
[33:34] than in the c in the in the thousand
[33:36] years before
[33:38] and so the the volume of printed
[33:40] material just went way up. Uh the cost
[33:43] went way down. It went down something
[33:44] like 100x over the next 50 years. And if
[33:47] you look at literacy, you know, it
[33:49] actually took a while because learning
[33:50] to read and write is, you know, it's
[33:52] quite hard. It takes an education
[33:53] system. It takes free time. You it takes
[33:56] like not having to work on a farm all
[33:57] day so that you actually have time for
[33:59] education and things like this. But over
[34:01] the next 200 years, it went up to like
[34:02] 70% globally. So I think this is the
[34:07] kind of thing that we might see is a
[34:10] similar kind of transition. And there
[34:13] was uh there was actually this
[34:14] interesting um historical document where
[34:16] there was an interview with some like
[34:17] scribe in the 1400s about like how do
[34:20] you feel about the printing press? And
[34:23] they were actually very excited because
[34:24] they were like actually the thing that I
[34:25] don't like doing is copying between
[34:27] books. The thing that I do like doing is
[34:29] drawing the art in books and then doing
[34:30] the book binding. And I'm really glad
[34:32] that now my time is freed up. And it's
[34:35] interesting like as an engineer I sort
[34:38] of felt like a peril with this. It's
[34:40] like this is sort of how I feel where I
[34:42] don't have to do the tedious work
[34:43] anymore of coding because this has
[34:46] always been sort of the detail of it.
[34:47] It's always been the tedious part of it
[34:49] and kind of like messing with like git
[34:50] and kind of using all these different
[34:52] tools. That that was not the fun part.
[34:54] The fun part is figuring out what to
[34:55] build and coming up with this. It's uh
[34:58] it's talking to users. It's thinking
[34:59] about these big systems. It's thinking
[35:01] about the future. It's collaborating
[35:03] with you know other people on the team.
[35:04] And that's what I get to do more of now.
[35:07] And what's amazing is that the tool
[35:09] you're building allows anybody to do
[35:11] this. People that have no technical
[35:13] experience can do exactly what you're
[35:14] describing. Like I'm I've been doing a
[35:16] bunch of random little projects and any
[35:18] it's just like anytime you get stuck
[35:20] just like help me figure this out and
[35:22] you get on block. Like I used to I was
[35:24] an engineer for early in my career for
[35:26] 10 years and I just remember spending so
[35:29] much time on like libraries and
[35:30] dependencies and things and just like oh
[35:32] my god what do I do and then looking on
[35:34] stack overflow and now it's just like
[35:35] help me figure this out and here's step
[35:37] by step one two three four okay we got
[35:39] this.
[35:39] >> Yeah exactly exactly I was talking to an
[35:41] engineer earlier today they're like
[35:43] they're writing some service and go and
[35:45] you know it's been like a month already
[35:46] and they they built up the service like
[35:47] it's working quite well and then I was
[35:49] like okay so like how do you feel
[35:50] writing it? He was like, you know, like
[35:51] I I still don't really know Go, but
[35:55] and I think we're going to start to see
[35:56] more and more of this. It's like if you
[35:58] know that it works correctly and
[35:59] efficiently, then you you don't actually
[36:01] have to know all the details. Clearly,
[36:03] the life of a software engineer has
[36:05] changed dramatically. It's like a whole
[36:07] new job now as of the past year or two.
[36:12] What do you think is the next role that
[36:13] will be most impacted by AI within
[36:16] either within tech like you know product
[36:18] managers, designers or even outside tech
[36:20] just like what do you think where do you
[36:21] think AI is going next?
[36:23] >> I think it's going to be a lot of the
[36:24] roles that are adjacent to engineering.
[36:26] Um so yeah it could be like product
[36:28] managers, it could be design, could be
[36:29] data science. It is going to expand to
[36:32] pretty much any kind of work that you
[36:34] can do on a computer because the model
[36:36] is just going to get better and better
[36:37] at this. Um, and you know, like this is
[36:39] the co-work product is kind of the first
[36:41] way to get at this, but it's just the
[36:43] first one. And
[36:45] it's the thing that I think brings AI to
[36:48] a agentic AI to people that haven't
[36:50] really used it before, and people are
[36:52] starting just to to to get a sense of it
[36:54] for the first time. When I think back to
[36:56] engineering a year ago, no one really
[36:58] knew what an agent was. No one really
[37:00] used it. But nowadays, it's just the way
[37:02] that, you know, we do we do our work.
[37:04] And then when I look at non-technical
[37:05] work today um so you know like or maybe
[37:09] semi-technical like product work and you
[37:10] know like data science and things like
[37:12] this when you look at the kinds of AI
[37:14] that people are using it's all it's
[37:15] always these like conversational AI it's
[37:17] like a chatbot or whatever but no one
[37:19] really has used an agent before and this
[37:22] word agent just gets thrown around all
[37:23] the time and it's just like so misused
[37:25] it's like lost all meaning but agent
[37:27] actually has like a very specific
[37:28] technical meaning which is it's a it's a
[37:31] AI it's a LM that's able to use tools.
[37:34] So it doesn't just talk, it can actually
[37:36] act and it can interact with your system
[37:39] and you know this means like it can use
[37:41] your Google docs and it can it can send
[37:43] email. It can run commands on your
[37:44] computer and do all this kind of stuff.
[37:46] So I think like any kind of job where
[37:48] you do you use computer tools in this
[37:50] way. I think this is going to be next.
[37:53] This is something we have to kind of
[37:54] figure out as a as a society. This is
[37:56] something we have to figure out as an
[37:57] industry. Um and I think for me also
[37:59] this is one of the reasons it it feels
[38:01] very important and urgent to do this
[38:03] work at anthropic because I think we
[38:06] take this very very seriously. Um and so
[38:08] now you know we have economists we have
[38:11] uh policy folks we have social impact
[38:12] folks this is something we just want to
[38:14] talk about a lot so as society we can
[38:16] kind of figure out what to do because it
[38:17] shouldn't be up to us.
[38:19] >> So the big question which you're kind of
[38:21] alluding to is jobs and job loss and
[38:22] things like that. There's this concept
[38:24] of Jevans paradox of just as we can do
[38:27] more we hire more and it's not actually
[38:29] as scary as it looks. What have you
[38:31] experienced so far I guess with AI
[38:33] becoming a big part of the engineering
[38:35] job? Just are you hiring more than if
[38:38] you didn't have AI and just thoughts on
[38:40] jobs?
[38:41] >> Yeah, I mean for our team we're we're
[38:43] hiring. Um so quadco team is hiring. Um
[38:46] if you're interested just check out the
[38:47] jobs page on on anthropic. Personally,
[38:50] it's, you know, all this stuff has just
[38:52] made me enjoy my work more. I have never
[38:56] enjoyed coding as much as I do today
[38:58] because I don't have to deal with all
[38:59] the minutia. So, for me personally, it's
[39:02] been quite exciting. This is something
[39:03] that we hear from a lot of customers
[39:05] where they love the tool, they love Quad
[39:07] Code because it just makes coding
[39:09] delightful again. Uh, and that's just
[39:12] that's just so fun for them. But it's
[39:14] hard to know where this thing is going
[39:16] to go. And I again I just like I have to
[39:18] reach for these historical analoges. Uh
[39:21] and I I think the printing press is just
[39:23] such a good one because what happened is
[39:26] this technology that was locked away to
[39:27] a small set of people like knowing how
[39:29] to read and write became accessible to
[39:31] everyone. It was just inherently
[39:32] democratizing. Everyone started to be
[39:35] able to do this. And if that wasn't the
[39:37] case then something like the Renaissance
[39:40] just could never have happened because a
[39:42] lot of the Renaissance it was about like
[39:44] knowledge spreading. It was about like
[39:45] written records that people used to
[39:47] communicate. Um, you know, cuz there
[39:49] were no phones or anything like this.
[39:52] There was there was no internet at the
[39:53] time. So, it's about like what does this
[39:55] enable next? And I think that's the very
[39:59] optimistic version of it for me. And
[40:00] that's the part that I'm really excited
[40:01] about. It's just unimaginable, you know,
[40:04] like we couldn't be talking today if the
[40:06] printing press hadn't been invented.
[40:07] Like our microphones wouldn't exist.
[40:09] None of the things around us would
[40:10] exist. it just wouldn't be possible to
[40:12] coordinate such a large group of people
[40:13] if that wasn't the case. And so I
[40:16] imagine a world, you know, a few years
[40:17] in the future where everyone is able to
[40:19] program. And what does that unlock?
[40:21] Anyone can just build software anytime.
[40:23] And I have no idea. It's just the same
[40:26] way that, you know, in the 1400s, no one
[40:28] could have predicted this. Um, I think
[40:29] it's the same way. But I do think in the
[40:31] meantime, it's going to be very
[40:32] disruptive and it's going to be painful
[40:34] for a lot of people. Um, and again, as a
[40:37] society, this is a conversation that we
[40:39] have to have and this is a thing that we
[40:41] have to figure out together.
[40:42] >> So, for folks hearing this that want to
[40:45] succeed and, you know, make it in this
[40:48] crazy turmoil we're entering, any
[40:50] advice? Is it, you know, play with AI
[40:52] tools, get really proficient at the
[40:53] latest stuff? Is there anything else
[40:55] that you recommend to help people uh
[40:57] stay ahead? Yeah, I think that's pretty
[40:59] much it. Uh, experiment with the tools,
[41:01] get to know them, don't be scared of
[41:02] them. um just you know dive in try them
[41:05] be on the bleeding edge beyond the
[41:06] frontier. Maybe the second piece of
[41:09] advice is try to be a generalist more
[41:12] than you have in the past. For example,
[41:14] in school a lot of people that study CS
[41:16] they learn to code and they don't really
[41:19] learn much else. Maybe they learn a
[41:21] little bit of systems architecture or
[41:23] something like this. But some of the
[41:25] most effective engineers that I work
[41:27] with every day and some of the most
[41:28] effective, you know, like product
[41:29] managers and so on, they cross over
[41:31] disciplines. So on the quad code team,
[41:33] everyone codes. You know, our product
[41:34] manager codes, our engineering manager
[41:36] codes, our designer codes, our finance
[41:39] guy codes, our data scientist codes.
[41:42] Like everyone on the team codes. And and
[41:43] then if I look at particular engineers,
[41:45] people often cross different
[41:47] disciplines. So some of the strongest
[41:48] engineers are hybrid product and
[41:50] infrastructure engineers or product
[41:53] engineers with really great design sense
[41:54] and they're able to do design also or an
[41:57] engineer that has a really good sense of
[41:58] the business and can use that to figure
[42:00] out what to do next. or an engineer that
[42:03] also loves talking to users and can just
[42:06] really channel what what users want to
[42:08] figure out what's next. So I think a lot
[42:11] of the people that will be rewarded the
[42:12] most over the next few years, they won't
[42:15] just be AI native and they don't just
[42:17] know how to use these tools really well,
[42:18] but also they're curious and they're
[42:21] generalists and they cross over multiple
[42:23] disciplines and can think about the
[42:25] broader problem they're solving rather
[42:27] than just the engineering part of it. Do
[42:29] you find these three separate
[42:30] disciplines still useful as a way to
[42:32] think about the team? They're, you know,
[42:33] engineering, design, uh, product
[42:35] management. Do you find like those, even
[42:37] though they are now coding and
[42:39] contributing to thinking about what to
[42:41] build, do you feel like those are three
[42:42] roles that will persist long term, at
[42:44] least at this point? I think in the
[42:46] short term it'll persist, but one thing
[42:48] that we're starting to see is there's
[42:49] maybe a 50% overlap in these roles where
[42:52] a lot of people are actually just doing
[42:53] the same thing and some people have
[42:54] specialties. for example, I code a
[42:56] little bit more versus cat RPM does a
[42:59] little bit more, you know, coordination
[43:00] or planning or, you know, forecasting or
[43:03] things like this.
[43:04] >> Stakeholder alignment.
[43:05] >> Stakeholder alignment. Exactly. I I do
[43:08] think that there's a future where I
[43:10] think by the end of the year what we're
[43:11] going to start to see is these start to
[43:13] get even murkier murkier where I think
[43:16] in some places the title software
[43:17] engineer is going to start to go away
[43:19] and it's just going to be replaced by
[43:21] builder or maybe it's just everyone's
[43:22] going to be a product manager and
[43:24] everyone codes or something like this.
[43:26] Who says hiring has to be fair? Every
[43:28] founder and hiring manager I've been
[43:30] speaking with these days is feeling the
[43:32] same pressure. Hire the best people as
[43:34] fast as possible. But recruiting is time
[43:37] consuming, alignment is hard, and
[43:40] competition for great talent keeps
[43:41] getting tighter. That's why teams like
[43:44] 11 Labs, Brex, Replet, Deal, and 5,000
[43:48] other organizations use MetaView, the AI
[43:51] company giving high performance teams a
[43:53] real unfair advantage in hiring. They
[43:55] give you a suite of AI agents that
[43:57] behave like recruiting co-workers. They
[43:59] find candidates for you based on your
[44:01] exact criteria, take interview notes
[44:04] automatically, gather insights across
[44:06] your hiring process, and help you
[44:08] identify the best candidates in your
[44:10] pipeline. AI handles the recruiting toil
[44:13] and gives you a real source of truth.
[44:15] That means hours saved per hire and a
[44:17] team focused on what matters most,
[44:19] winning the right candidates. Don't let
[44:22] your competitors outhire you. Metav
[44:25] customers close roles 30% faster. Try
[44:28] Metaview today for free and get an extra
[44:30] month of sourcing at metaview.ai/lenny.
[44:34] That's me.
[44:37] Lenny. You talked about how you're
[44:39] enjoying coding more. I actually did
[44:40] this little informal survey on Twitter.
[44:42] I don't know if you saw this where I
[44:44] just asked I did three different polls.
[44:46] I asked engineers, are you enjoying your
[44:48] job more or less since adopting AI
[44:49] tools? And then I did a separate one for
[44:51] PMs and one for designers. And both
[44:54] engineers and PMs, 70% of people said
[44:57] they are enjoying their job more and
[44:59] about 10% said they're enjoying their
[45:01] job less. Designers, interestingly, only
[45:04] 55% said they are enjoying their job
[45:07] more and 20% said they're enjoying their
[45:09] job less. Thought that was really
[45:11] interesting.
[45:11] >> That's super interesting. I' I'd love to
[45:13] talk to these people uh you know, both
[45:15] in the more bucket and the less bucket
[45:17] just to understand. Do did you get to
[45:18] follow up with any of them? They a few
[45:20] people replied and we're actually doing
[45:22] a follow poll that we'll link to in the
[45:23] show notes of going deeper into some of
[45:25] the stuff, but a lot of there's like,
[45:27] you know, the factors that make it more
[45:29] fun and less fun. The designers, they
[45:31] didn't share a lot actually of just like
[45:32] the people that are actually asked just
[45:34] like why are you enjoying your job less?
[45:35] And I didn't hear a lot. So, I'm curious
[45:36] what's going on there.
[45:37] >> Yeah, I I'm seeing this a little bit
[45:38] with uh at anthropic. I think everyone
[45:40] is fairly technical.
[45:43] This is something that we screen for,
[45:45] you know, when when people join. We have
[45:47] there there's a lot of technical
[45:48] interviews that people go go through
[45:50] even for non-technical functions.
[45:52] Uh and you know our designers largely
[45:56] code. So I think for them this is
[45:58] something that they have enjoyed from
[46:01] what I've seen because now instead of
[46:04] bugging engineers they can just like go
[46:05] in and code. And even some designers
[46:07] that didn't code before have just
[46:08] started to do it and for them it's great
[46:10] cuz they can unblock themselves. But I'd
[46:13] be really interested just to hear more
[46:14] people's experiences cuz I I I bet it's
[46:16] not uniform like that.
[46:17] >> Yeah. So maybe if you're listening to
[46:19] this, leave a comment if you're finding
[46:20] your jobs less fun and enjoying your job
[46:22] less cuz what you're saying and what I'm
[46:24] hearing from most people, 70% of PMs and
[46:27] engineers are loving their job more.
[46:28] That's like if you're not in that
[46:30] bucket, you could something's going on.
[46:32] >> Yeah. Yeah. We do see that people use
[46:34] also different tools. So for example,
[46:36] our designers, they use uh the cloud
[46:38] desktop app a lot more to to do their
[46:40] coding. So you just download the desktop
[46:42] app. There's a code tab. Uh it's right
[46:44] next to co-work and it's actually the
[46:46] same exact quad code. So it's like the
[46:47] same agent and everything. We've had
[46:48] this for, you know, for many, many
[46:50] months. Uh and so you can use this to
[46:52] code in a way that you don't have to
[46:53] open a bunch of terminals, but you still
[46:56] get the power of quad code. And the
[46:58] biggest thing is you can just run as
[46:59] many, you know, quad sessions in
[47:00] parallel as you want. We, you know, we
[47:02] call this multi-quading.
[47:04] >> So this is a it's it's a little more
[47:06] native, I think, for folks that are not
[47:07] engineers. And really, this is back to
[47:10] bringing the product to where the people
[47:12] are. You don't want to make people use a
[47:13] different workflow. You don't want to
[47:14] make them go out of their way to learn a
[47:16] new thing. It's whatever people are
[47:18] doing, if you can make that a little bit
[47:19] easier, then that's just going to be a
[47:21] much better product that people enjoy
[47:23] more. And this is just this principle of
[47:25] latent demand, which I I think is just
[47:26] the the single most important principle
[47:28] in product.
[47:29] >> Can you talk about that actually because
[47:30] I was going to go there. Explain what
[47:32] this principle is and and and just what
[47:35] happens when you unlock this latent
[47:36] demand. Latent demand is this idea that
[47:39] if you build a product in a way that can
[47:41] be hacked or can be kind of mi misused
[47:44] by people in a way it wasn't really
[47:46] designed for to do kind of something
[47:48] that they want to do then this helps you
[47:51] as the product builder learn where to
[47:53] take the product next. So an example of
[47:56] this is uh Facebook marketplace. So the
[47:58] the manager for the team Fiona she she
[48:01] was actually the founding manager for uh
[48:03] the marketplace team and she talks about
[48:04] this a lot.
[48:06] Facebook Marketplace. It started based
[48:08] on the observation back in uh this must
[48:10] have been like 20 2016 or or something
[48:12] like this that 40% of posts in Facebook
[48:15] groups are buying and selling stuff. So
[48:17] this is crazy. It's like people are
[48:19] abusing the Facebook groups product to
[48:20] buy and sell. And it's not it's not
[48:22] abuse in kind of like a security sense.
[48:23] It's abuse in that no one designed the
[48:25] product for this, but they're kind of
[48:26] figuring it out because it's just so
[48:28] useful for this. And so it was pretty
[48:30] obvious if you build a better product to
[48:32] let people buy and sell, they're going
[48:33] to like it. And it was just very obvious
[48:35] that marketplace would be a hit from
[48:37] this. And so the first thing was buy and
[48:38] sell groups. So kind of special purpose
[48:40] groups to let people do that. And the
[48:42] second product was marketplace.
[48:45] Uh Facebook dating I think started in a
[48:47] pretty similar place. And I think that
[48:49] the observation was if you look at
[48:51] people looking if you look at uh profile
[48:53] views so people looking at each other's
[48:54] profiles on Facebook 60% of profile
[48:57] views were people that are not friends
[48:58] with each other that are opposite
[48:59] gender. And so this is this kind of like
[49:02] you know like traditional kind of dating
[49:04] setup but you know people are just like
[49:05] creeping on each other. So maybe if you
[49:07] can build a product for this it's you
[49:08] know it might work. Um and so this idea
[49:12] of latent demand I think is just so
[49:14] powerful. And for example this is also
[49:17] where co-work came from. We saw that for
[49:20] the last 6 months or so a lot of people
[49:22] using quad code were not using it to
[49:24] code. There was someone on Twitter that
[49:26] was using it to grow tomato plants.
[49:27] There was someone else using it to
[49:28] analyze their genome. Someone was using
[49:31] it to uh recover photos from a corrupted
[49:33] hard drive. It was like uh wedding
[49:34] photos. Uh there was someone that was
[49:37] using it for uh I think like uh they
[49:41] they were using it to analyze a MRI. So
[49:43] there there's just all these different
[49:45] use cases that are not technical at all.
[49:47] And it was just really obvious like
[49:48] people are jumping through hoops to use
[49:51] a terminal to do this thing. Maybe we
[49:53] should just build a product for them.
[49:55] And we saw this actually pretty early
[49:57] back in maybe May of last year. I
[49:59] remember walking into the office and our
[50:01] data scientist Brendan was had a quad
[50:03] code on his uh computer. He just had a
[50:05] terminal up and I was like I was
[50:08] shocked. I was like Brendan what what
[50:10] are you doing? Like you you figured out
[50:11] how to open the terminal which is you
[50:14] know it's a very engineering product.
[50:15] Even a lot of engineers don't want to
[50:16] use a terminal. It's just like a it's
[50:18] like just like the lowest level way to
[50:20] to do your work. Um just really really
[50:23] uh kind of in the weeds of the computer.
[50:26] And so he figured out how to use the
[50:27] terminal. He downloaded Node.js. He
[50:29] downloaded quad code and he was doing
[50:31] SQL analysis in a terminal and it was
[50:33] crazy. And then the next week all the
[50:34] data scientists were doing the same
[50:35] thing. So when you see people abusing
[50:37] the product in this way, using it in a
[50:39] way that it wasn't designed in order to
[50:40] do something that is useful for them,
[50:42] it's just such a strong indicator that
[50:45] you should just build a product and and
[50:47] people are going to like that. It's
[50:48] something that's special purpose for
[50:49] that. I think now there there's also
[50:51] this kind of interesting second
[50:52] dimension to latent demand. This is sort
[50:54] of the traditional framing is look at
[50:56] what people are doing, make that a
[50:57] little bit easier, empower them. The
[51:00] modern framing that I've been seeing in
[51:01] the last 6 months is a little bit
[51:03] different and it's look at what the
[51:05] model is trying to do and make that a
[51:08] little bit easier.
[51:10] And so when we first started building
[51:12] quad code, I think a lot of the way that
[51:13] people approached designing things with
[51:16] LLMs is they kind of put the model in a
[51:18] box and they were like, here's this
[51:20] application that I want to build. Here's
[51:21] the thing that I wanted to do. model,
[51:22] you're going to do this one component of
[51:24] it. Here's the way that you're going to
[51:25] interact with these tools and APIs and
[51:26] whatever. And for cloud code, we
[51:28] inverted that. We said the product is
[51:30] the model. We want to expose it. We want
[51:32] to put the minimal scaffolding around
[51:34] it. Give it the minimal set of tools.
[51:36] So, it can do the things. It can decide
[51:37] which tools to run. It can decide in
[51:38] what order to run them in and so on. And
[51:41] I I think a lot of this was just based
[51:43] on kind of latent demand of what the
[51:44] model wanted to do. And so, in research,
[51:46] we call this being on distribution. Uh
[51:48] you want to see like what the model is
[51:50] trying to do. In product terms, latent
[51:51] demand is just the same exact concept
[51:53] but applied to a model.
[51:55] >> You talked about co-work something that
[51:56] I saw you talk about when you launched
[51:58] that initially is you your team built
[51:59] that in 10 days.
[52:01] >> That's insane. Uh I it came out I think
[52:03] it was like you know used by millions of
[52:05] people pretty quickly something like
[52:07] that being built in 10 days. Uh anything
[52:09] there any stories there other than just
[52:11] it was just you know we use cloud code
[52:12] to build it and that's it.
[52:14] >> Yeah it's funny. Uh cloud code like I
[52:16] said when we released it was not
[52:18] immediately a hit. it became a hit over
[52:20] time and there was a few inflection
[52:21] points. So one was you know like Opus 4
[52:24] uh it just really really inflected and
[52:25] then in November it inflected and it
[52:27] just keeps inflecting. The growth just
[52:29] keeps getting steeper and steeper and
[52:30] steeper every day. But you know for the
[52:32] first few months it wasn't a hit. Uh
[52:34] people used it but a lot of people
[52:36] couldn't figure out how to use it. They
[52:37] didn't know what it was for. The model
[52:39] still like wasn't very good. Co-work
[52:41] when we released it was just immediately
[52:43] a hit much more so than cloud code was
[52:45] early on. I think a lot of the credit
[52:47] honestly just goes to like Felix and and
[52:49] Sam and the and Jenny and the the team
[52:52] that built this. It's just an incredibly
[52:53] strong team. And again, the the place co
[52:56] came from is just this latent demand.
[52:58] Like we saw people using quad code for
[52:59] these non-technical things and we're
[53:01] trying to figure out what do we do? And
[53:02] so for a few months the team was
[53:03] exploring they were trying all sorts of
[53:05] different options and in the end someone
[53:07] was just like okay what what if we just
[53:10] take quad code and put it in the desktop
[53:12] app and that's essentially the thing
[53:14] that worked. And so over 10 days they
[53:17] just completely use quad code to build
[53:18] it. Uh and you know co-work is actually
[53:21] there's this very sophisticated security
[53:23] system that's that's built in and
[53:25] essentially these guard rails to make
[53:26] sure that the model kind of does the
[53:28] right thing. It doesn't go off the
[53:29] rails. So for example we ship an entire
[53:32] virtual machine with it. And quad code
[53:34] just wrote all of this code. So we just
[53:36] had to think about all right how do we
[53:37] make this a little bit safer a little
[53:38] more self-guided for uh people that are
[53:40] not engineers. It was fully implemented
[53:42] with quad code. took about 10 days. We
[53:45] launched it early. You know, it was
[53:47] still pretty rough and it's still pretty
[53:48] rough around the edges. But this is kind
[53:50] of the way that we learn um both on the
[53:52] product side and on the safety side is
[53:54] we have to release things a little bit
[53:56] earlier than we think so that we can get
[53:59] the feedback so that we can talk to
[54:00] users. We can understand what people
[54:02] want and and that will shape where the
[54:04] product goes in the future.
[54:05] >> Yeah, I think that point is so
[54:06] interesting and and it's so unique.
[54:08] There's always been this idea release
[54:10] early, learn from users, get feedback,
[54:12] iterate. The fact that it's hard to even
[54:15] know what the AI is capable of and how
[54:17] people will try to use it is like is a
[54:20] unique reason to start releasing things
[54:23] early that'll help you as you exactly
[54:25] describe this idea of what is the latent
[54:27] demand in this thing that we didn't
[54:28] really know. Let's put it out there and
[54:29] see what people do with it.
[54:30] >> Yeah. And in philanthropic as a safety
[54:31] lab, the other dimension of that is
[54:33] safety because um you know like when you
[54:35] think about model safety, there's a
[54:36] bunch of different ways to study it.
[54:38] Sort of the lowest level is alignment
[54:40] and mechanistic interpretability. So
[54:42] this is when we train the model, we want
[54:44] to make sure that it's safe. We at this
[54:47] point have like pretty sophisticated
[54:48] technology to understand what's
[54:50] happening in the neurons to trace it.
[54:52] And so for example like if there's a
[54:53] neuron related to deception we can start
[54:56] we're starting to get to the point where
[54:57] we can monitor it and understand that
[54:59] it's activating. Um and so this is just
[55:01] this is alignment this is mechanistic
[55:02] interpretability. It's like the lowest
[55:04] layer. The second layer is evolves and
[55:07] this is essentially a laboratory
[55:08] setting. The model is in a petri dish
[55:09] and you study it and you put in a
[55:11] synthetic situation and just say okay
[55:13] like model what do you do and are you
[55:15] doing the right thing? Is it aligned? Is
[55:16] it safe? And then the third layer is
[55:19] seeing how the model behaves in the
[55:20] wild. And as the model gets more
[55:23] sophisticated, this this becomes so
[55:25] important because it might look very
[55:27] good on these first two layers but not
[55:28] great on the third one. We released
[55:31] cloud code really early because we
[55:33] wanted to study safety and we actually
[55:35] used it within anthropic for I think
[55:37] four or 5 months or something before we
[55:39] released it because we weren't really
[55:41] sure like this is the first agent that
[55:43] you know the first big agent that I
[55:45] think folks had released at that point.
[55:47] um it was definitely the first uh you
[55:49] know coding agent that became broadly
[55:50] used and so we weren't sure if it was
[55:52] safe and so we actually had to study it
[55:54] internally for a long time before we
[55:55] felt good about that and even since you
[55:58] know there's a lot that we've learned
[55:59] about alignment there's a lot that we've
[56:00] learned about safety that we've been
[56:01] able to put back into the model back
[56:03] into the product and for co-work it's
[56:05] pretty similar uh the model's in this
[56:07] new setting it's you know doing these
[56:09] tasks that are not engineering tasks
[56:10] it's an agent that's acting on your
[56:12] behalf it looks good on alignment it
[56:14] looks good on evals we try to internally
[56:16] it looks good we it with a few
[56:17] customers, it looks good. Now, we have
[56:19] to make sure it's safe in the real
[56:20] world. And so, that's why we release a
[56:22] little early. That's why we call it a
[56:23] research preview. Um, but yeah, it's
[56:25] just it's constantly improving. Um, and
[56:27] this is really the only way to to make
[56:29] sure that over the long term the model
[56:30] is aligned and it's doing the right
[56:32] things. It's such a wild space that you
[56:35] work in where there's this insane
[56:36] competition and pace. At the same time,
[56:39] there's this fear that if you get some
[56:41] if the the you know the god can escape
[56:43] and cause damage and just finding that
[56:45] balance must be so challenging. What I'm
[56:48] hearing is there's kind of these three
[56:49] layers and I know there's like this
[56:50] could be a whole podcast conversation is
[56:52] how you all think about the safety piece
[56:54] but just what I'm hearing is there's
[56:55] these three layers you work with. Uh
[56:56] there's kind of like observing the model
[56:58] thinking and operating. There's tests
[57:01] eval that tell you this is doing bad
[57:03] things and then releasing it early. I
[57:05] haven't actually heard a ton about that
[57:06] first piece. That is so cool. So you
[57:08] guys can there's an observability tool
[57:11] that can let you peek inside the model's
[57:13] brain and see how it's thinking and
[57:14] where it's heading. Yeah, you should uh
[57:17] you should at some point have Chris Ola
[57:18] on the podcast because uh he he's just
[57:20] the industry expert on this. He he
[57:22] invented this field of uh we call it
[57:23] mechanistic interpretability. Uh and the
[57:26] the idea is uh you know like at its core
[57:29] like what is your brain? Like what are
[57:31] what is it? It's like it's a bunch of
[57:32] neurons that are connected. And so what
[57:33] you can do is like in a human brain or
[57:35] animal brain you can study it at this
[57:38] kind of mechanistic level to understand
[57:39] what the neurons are doing. It turns out
[57:41] surprisingly a lot of this does
[57:43] translate to models also. So model
[57:45] neurons are not the same as animal
[57:47] neurons but they behave similarly in a
[57:49] lot of ways. And so we've been able to
[57:51] learn just a ton about the way these
[57:52] neurons work, about, you know, this
[57:54] layer or this neuron maps to this
[57:56] concept, how particular concepts are
[57:58] encoded, how the model does planning,
[58:01] how it how it thinks ahead, you know,
[58:03] like a long time ago, we weren't sure if
[58:05] the model is just predicting the next
[58:06] token or is doing something a little bit
[58:08] deeper. Now, I think there's actually
[58:10] quite strong evidence that it is doing
[58:12] something a little bit deeper. And then
[58:13] the structures that were to do this are
[58:15] pretty sophisticated now where as the
[58:18] models get bigger, it's not just like a
[58:19] single neuron that corresponds to a
[58:21] concept. A single neuron might
[58:22] correspond to a dozen concepts. And if
[58:24] it's activated together with other
[58:26] neurons, this is called superposition.
[58:28] And uh together it represents this more
[58:30] sophisticated concept. And it's just
[58:33] something we're learning about all the
[58:34] time, you know, and philanthropic as as
[58:36] we think about the way this space
[58:38] evolves,
[58:40] doing this in a way that is safe and
[58:42] good for the world is just this is the
[58:43] reason that we exist and this is the
[58:46] reason that everyone is at anthropic.
[58:47] Uh, everyone that is here, this is the
[58:49] reason why they're here. So, a lot of
[58:51] this work we actually open source. Uh,
[58:52] we publish it a lot. Um and you know we
[58:55] publish very freely to talk about this
[58:57] just so we can inspire other labs that
[58:58] are working on similar things to do it
[59:01] in a way that's safe and this is
[59:03] something that we've been doing for
[59:04] cloud code also we call this the race to
[59:06] the top uh internally and so for cloud
[59:10] code for example we released an open
[59:11] source sandbox and this is a sandbox
[59:14] they can run the the agent in and it
[59:17] just makes sure that there's certain
[59:18] boundaries and it can't access like
[59:19] everything on your system. Uh, and we
[59:21] made that open source and it actually
[59:23] works with any agent, not just quad code
[59:25] because we wanted to make it really easy
[59:26] for others to do the same thing. Um, so
[59:29] this is just the same principle of race
[59:30] to the top. Um, we we want to make sure
[59:33] this thing goes well and this is just
[59:34] the this is the lever that we have.
[59:37] >> Incredible. Okay, I definitely want to
[59:38] spend more time on that. I I will follow
[59:40] up with this suggestion. Something else
[59:42] that I've been noticing in the in the
[59:45] field across engineers, product
[59:47] managers, others that work with agents
[59:49] is there's this kind of anxiety people
[59:51] feel when their agents aren't working.
[59:54] There's a sense that like, oh man, Nza
[59:57] has a question, I need to answer or it's
[59:58] like blocked on something or it's or I
[1:00:01] just like I I'm like there's all this
[1:00:02] productivity I'm losing. I can't like I
[1:00:04] need to wake up and get it going again.
[1:00:06] Is that something you feel? Is that
[1:00:07] something your team feels? Do you feel
[1:00:08] like this is a a problem we need to
[1:00:10] track and think about? I always have a
[1:00:12] bunch of agents running. So like at the
[1:00:13] moment I have like five agents running
[1:00:15] and at any moment like you know like I I
[1:00:17] wake up and I I stored a bunch of
[1:00:18] agents. Like the first thing I did when
[1:00:20] I woke up is like oh man I I want I
[1:00:22] really want to check this thing. So like
[1:00:23] I opened up my phone quad iOS app code
[1:00:26] tab uh you know like agent do do blah
[1:00:28] blah blah cuz I I wrote some code
[1:00:30] yesterday and I was like wait did did I
[1:00:32] do this right? I was like kind of double
[1:00:33] double guessing something and it and it
[1:00:35] was correct. But now it's just like so
[1:00:37] easy to do this. So I don't know, there
[1:00:39] is this little bit of anxiety. Maybe I
[1:00:42] personally haven't really felt it just
[1:00:43] cuz I have agents running all the time.
[1:00:45] Um, and I'm also just like not locked
[1:00:47] into a terminal anymore. Maybe a third
[1:00:49] of my code now is in the terminal, but
[1:00:50] also a third is uh using the desktop app
[1:00:53] and then a third is the iOS app, which
[1:00:56] is just so surprising cuz I did not
[1:00:58] think that this would be the way that I
[1:00:59] code uh in even in 2026. I love that you
[1:01:03] describe it as coding still, which is
[1:01:05] just talking to the to cloud code to
[1:01:07] code for you essentially. And it's
[1:01:09] interesting that this is now like this
[1:01:10] is now coding. Coding now is describing
[1:01:13] what you want, not writing actual code.
[1:01:16] >> I I I kind of wonder if uh the people
[1:01:18] that used to code using punch cards or
[1:01:20] whatever, if you show them software,
[1:01:21] what they would have said. Isn't that
[1:01:23] crazy? And I I remember reading
[1:01:25] something this was maybe like very early
[1:01:26] versions of like ACM uh like like
[1:01:29] magazine or something where people were
[1:01:32] saying no it's not the same thing like
[1:01:33] this isn't this isn't really coding uh
[1:01:35] and you know like they called it
[1:01:36] programming I think coding is kind of a
[1:01:38] new word
[1:01:39] >> but I kind of think about this like in
[1:01:40] the back in the you know my family is
[1:01:42] from the Soviet Union I you know I I was
[1:01:44] born in Ukraine um and my grandpa was
[1:01:46] actually one of the first programmers in
[1:01:48] the Soviet Union and he programmed using
[1:01:51] punch cards And uh you know like he he
[1:01:54] told my mom uh growing up told these
[1:01:56] stories of like or she she told these
[1:01:58] stories that when she was growing up he
[1:01:59] would bring these punch cards home and
[1:02:01] there was these like big stacks of punch
[1:02:03] cards and for her she would like draw
[1:02:05] all over them with crayons and that was
[1:02:06] like her childhood memory but for him
[1:02:08] that was like his experience of
[1:02:10] programming and he actually never saw
[1:02:11] the software transition but at some
[1:02:13] point it did transition to software and
[1:02:15] I think there's probably this older
[1:02:16] generation of programmers that just
[1:02:18] didn't take software very seriously and
[1:02:20] they would have been like well you know
[1:02:21] it's not really coding.
[1:02:22] But I I think this is a field that just
[1:02:24] has always been changing in this way.
[1:02:26] >> Uh I don't think you know this, but I
[1:02:28] was born in Ukraine also.
[1:02:30] >> Oh, I don't know. Yeah. Which time?
[1:02:32] >> I'm I'm from Odessa.
[1:02:34] >> Oh, me too.
[1:02:36] >> What?
[1:02:36] >> Yeah, that's crazy.
[1:02:39] >> Wow. Incredible. What a moment. Uh maybe
[1:02:42] related in some small way.
[1:02:44] >> Uh what year did your home did you leave
[1:02:46] and your family leave?
[1:02:48] >> Uh we came in 95.
[1:02:50] >> Okay. We left in ' 88. a little earlier.
[1:02:52] >> Oh, yeah.
[1:02:53] >> What a different life that would have
[1:02:54] been to not to not leave, huh?
[1:02:57] >> Yeah. I just I feel I feel so lucky
[1:02:59] every day that uh get get to grow up
[1:03:01] here.
[1:03:02] >> Yeah. My family anytime there's like a
[1:03:03] toaster or a meal, they're just like to
[1:03:05] America.
[1:03:07] It's like, okay, enough about that. But
[1:03:09] you get it, you know, once you start
[1:03:10] really thinking about what life could
[1:03:11] have been.
[1:03:12] >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We do we do
[1:03:14] the same toast, but it's still vodka.
[1:03:16] >> It's still vodka. Absolutely.
[1:03:19] Oh, man. Okay. Let me ask you a couple
[1:03:21] more things here. You shared some really
[1:03:23] cool tips for how to get the most out of
[1:03:26] AI, how to build on AI, how to build
[1:03:28] great products on AI. One tip you shared
[1:03:30] is give your team as many tokens as they
[1:03:32] want. Just like let them experiment. You
[1:03:34] also shared just advice generally of
[1:03:36] just build towards the model where the
[1:03:38] model is going, not to where it is
[1:03:39] today. What other advice do you have for
[1:03:40] folks that are trying to build AI
[1:03:42] products?
[1:03:42] >> I'd probably share a few more things.
[1:03:44] So, one is don't try to box the model
[1:03:46] in. Um I I think a lot of people's
[1:03:48] instinct when they build on the model is
[1:03:51] they try to make it behave a very
[1:03:52] particular way. They're like this is a
[1:03:54] component of a bigger system. I I think
[1:03:56] some examples of this are people
[1:03:58] layering like very strict workflows on
[1:03:59] the model for example you know to say
[1:04:01] like you must do step one then step two
[1:04:03] then step three and you have this like
[1:04:04] very fancy orchestrator doing this. But
[1:04:06] actually almost always you get better
[1:04:07] results if you just give the model tools
[1:04:09] you give it a goal and you let it figure
[1:04:10] it out. I think a year ago you actually
[1:04:12] needed a lot of the scaffolding but
[1:04:14] nowadays you don't really need it. So,
[1:04:16] you know, I I don't know what to call
[1:04:18] this principle, but it's like, you know,
[1:04:19] like ask not what the model can do for
[1:04:21] you. Maybe maybe it's something like
[1:04:22] this. Just think about how do you give
[1:04:25] the model the tools to do things. Don't
[1:04:26] try to overcurate it. Don't try to put
[1:04:28] it into a box. Don't try to give it a
[1:04:30] bunch of context up front. Give it a
[1:04:32] tool so that it can get the context it
[1:04:33] needs. You're just going to get better
[1:04:35] results.
[1:04:37] I think a second one is um maybe
[1:04:40] actually like a a more even more general
[1:04:42] version of this principle is just the
[1:04:44] bitter lesson.
[1:04:45] Uh and actually for the quad code team
[1:04:47] we have a you know hopefully hopefully
[1:04:49] um listeners have have read this but
[1:04:51] Rich Sutton had this blog post maybe 10
[1:04:53] years ago called the bitter lesson. Uh
[1:04:55] and it's actually a really simple idea.
[1:04:57] His idea was that the more general model
[1:04:59] will always outperform the more specific
[1:05:01] model and I think for him he was talking
[1:05:03] about like self-driving cars and other
[1:05:05] domains like this but actually there's
[1:05:07] just so many corlaries to the bitter
[1:05:09] lesson. And for me, the biggest one is
[1:05:12] just always bet on the more general
[1:05:14] model and you know over the long term
[1:05:16] like don't don't try to use tiny models
[1:05:18] for stuff. Don't try to like fine-tune.
[1:05:19] Don't try to do any of this stuff.
[1:05:21] There's like some applications you know
[1:05:22] there's some reasons to do this but
[1:05:24] almost always try to bet on the more
[1:05:26] general model if you can if you have
[1:05:27] that flexibility.
[1:05:29] Um and so these workflows are
[1:05:30] essentially a way that uh you know it's
[1:05:33] it's not it's not a general model. It's
[1:05:35] putting the scaffolding around it. And
[1:05:36] in general what we see is maybe
[1:05:38] scaffolding can improve performance
[1:05:39] maybe 10 20% something like this but
[1:05:42] often these gains just get wiped out
[1:05:44] with the next model. Uh so it's almost
[1:05:47] better to just wait for the next one.
[1:05:50] And I think maybe this is a final
[1:05:51] principle and something that quad code I
[1:05:53] think got right in hindsight. From the
[1:05:56] very beginning, we bet on building for
[1:05:58] the model six months from now, not for
[1:06:01] the model of today.
[1:06:03] And for the very early versions of the
[1:06:06] product, it just wrote so little of my
[1:06:08] code cuz I I didn't trust it cuz, you
[1:06:10] know, it was like sonnet 3.5, then it
[1:06:12] was like 3.6 or forget 3 3.5 new,
[1:06:15] whatever whatever whatever name we gave
[1:06:16] it. Um, these models just weren't very
[1:06:19] good at coding yet. Um, they were they
[1:06:20] were getting there, but it was still
[1:06:21] pretty early. So back then the model did
[1:06:25] uh you used git for me it automated some
[1:06:28] things but it it really wasn't doing a
[1:06:29] huge amount of my coding and so the bet
[1:06:32] with quad code was at some point the
[1:06:33] model gets good enough that it can just
[1:06:36] write a lot of the code and this is a
[1:06:38] thing that we first started seeing with
[1:06:39] opus 4 and sonnet 4 and opus 4 was our
[1:06:41] first kind of ASL3 class model uh that
[1:06:44] we released back in May and we just saw
[1:06:47] this inflection because everyone started
[1:06:49] to use quad code for the first time and
[1:06:51] that was kind of when our growth really
[1:06:52] went exponential and like I said it's
[1:06:54] kind of it stayed there. So I think this
[1:06:56] is some this is advice that I actually
[1:06:58] give to to a lot of folks especially
[1:07:00] people building startups. It's going to
[1:07:02] be uncomfortable cuz your product market
[1:07:04] fit won't be very good for the first 6
[1:07:05] months but if you build for the model 6
[1:07:08] months out when that model comes out
[1:07:11] you're just going to hit the ground
[1:07:12] running and the product is going to
[1:07:13] click and and start to work. And when
[1:07:16] you say build for the model 6 months out
[1:07:18] what is what is it that you think people
[1:07:19] can assume will happen? Is it just
[1:07:21] generally it will get better at things?
[1:07:23] Is it just like okay, it's like almost
[1:07:26] good enough and that's a sign that it'll
[1:07:28] probably get better at that thing. Is
[1:07:29] there any advice there?
[1:07:30] >> I think that's a good way to do it.
[1:07:31] Like, you know, obviously within an AI
[1:07:33] lab, we get to see the specific ways
[1:07:34] that it gets better.
[1:07:36] >> So, it's a it's a little unfair, but we
[1:07:38] we also we try to talk about this. So,
[1:07:41] you know, like one of the ways that it's
[1:07:42] going to get better is it's going to get
[1:07:44] better and better at using tools and
[1:07:45] using computers.
[1:07:47] This is a bet that I would make. Uh,
[1:07:49] another one is it's going to get better
[1:07:50] and better for long for running for long
[1:07:52] periods of time. And this is a place,
[1:07:55] you know, like there's all sorts of
[1:07:56] studies about this, but if you just
[1:07:57] trace the trajectory or, you know, maybe
[1:07:59] even like for my own experience when I
[1:08:01] used Sonnet 3.5 back, you know, a year
[1:08:03] ago, it could run for maybe 15 or 30
[1:08:06] seconds before before it started going
[1:08:09] off the rails and you just really had to
[1:08:10] hold its hand through any kind of
[1:08:12] complicated task. But nowadays with Opus
[1:08:14] 4.6, fix, you know, on average it'll run
[1:08:16] maybe 10, 30, 20, 30 minutes unattended
[1:08:19] and I'll just like start another quad
[1:08:21] and have it do something else. And you
[1:08:23] know, like I said, I always have a bunch
[1:08:24] of quads running. Uh, and they can also
[1:08:26] run for hours or even days at a time. I
[1:08:29] think there are some examples where they
[1:08:30] ran for many weeks. And so I think over
[1:08:32] time this is going to become more and
[1:08:33] more normal where the models are running
[1:08:35] for a very very long period of time and
[1:08:37] you you don't have to sit there and
[1:08:38] babysit them anymore.
[1:08:39] >> So we just talked about tips for
[1:08:41] building AI products. Any tips for
[1:08:43] someone just using cloud code say for
[1:08:45] the first time or just someone already
[1:08:46] using cloud code that wants to get
[1:08:48] better? What are like a couple pro tips
[1:08:50] that you could share?
[1:08:51] >> I will give a caveat which is there's no
[1:08:53] one right way to use quad code. So I I
[1:08:55] can share some tips but honestly this is
[1:08:57] a dev tool. Developers are all
[1:08:59] different. Developers have different
[1:09:00] preferences. They have different
[1:09:01] environments. So there's just so many
[1:09:03] ways to use these tools. There's no one
[1:09:05] right way. Um you you sort of have to
[1:09:07] find your own path. Luckily you can ask
[1:09:09] Quad Code. Uh it's able to make
[1:09:11] recommendations. It can edit your
[1:09:12] settings. It kind of knows about itself.
[1:09:14] So, it can help it can help with that. A
[1:09:17] few tips that generally I find pretty
[1:09:18] useful. So, number one is just use the
[1:09:20] most capable model. Um, currently that's
[1:09:22] Opus 4.6. I have maximum effort enabled
[1:09:24] always. The thing that happens is
[1:09:27] sometimes people try to use a less
[1:09:28] expensive model like sonnet or something
[1:09:30] like this. But because it's less
[1:09:32] intelligent, it actually takes more
[1:09:33] tokens in the end to do the same task.
[1:09:35] Um, and so it's actually not obvious
[1:09:36] that it's cheaper if you use a less
[1:09:38] expensive model. often it's actually
[1:09:40] cheaper and less token intensive if you
[1:09:42] use the most capable model because it
[1:09:44] can just do the same thing much faster
[1:09:45] with less correction, less uh less
[1:09:47] handholding and so on. So that's the
[1:09:49] first tip is just use the best model.
[1:09:51] The second one is use plan mode. I start
[1:09:55] almost all of my tasks in plan mode,
[1:09:57] maybe like 80%. And plan mode is
[1:09:59] actually really simple. All it is is we
[1:10:02] inject one sentence into the model's
[1:10:04] prompt to say please don't write any
[1:10:05] code yet. That's it. like there's
[1:10:07] there's actually like nothing fancy
[1:10:08] going on. It's just the simplest thing.
[1:10:10] >> Um, and so for people that are in the
[1:10:12] terminal, it's just shift tab twice and
[1:10:14] that gets you into plan mode. Uh, for
[1:10:16] people in the desktop app, there's a
[1:10:17] little button. On web, there's a little
[1:10:19] button. It's coming pretty soon to
[1:10:20] mobile also. Uh, and we just launched it
[1:10:22] for the SWAC integration, too. Uh, so
[1:10:25] plan mode is the second one. And uh,
[1:10:28] essentially the model would just go back
[1:10:29] and forth with you. Once the plan looks
[1:10:31] good, then you let the model execute. I
[1:10:33] auto accept edits after that because if
[1:10:35] the plan looks good, it's just going to
[1:10:36] oneshot it. It'll get it right the first
[1:10:38] time almost every time with Opus 4.6.
[1:10:42] And then maybe the third tip is just
[1:10:43] play around with different interfaces. I
[1:10:45] think a lot of people when they think
[1:10:46] about cloud code, they think about a
[1:10:47] terminal. Um, and you know, of course,
[1:10:49] we support every terminal. We support
[1:10:50] like Mac, Windows, you know, like
[1:10:52] whatever terminal you might use, it
[1:10:53] works perfectly. But we actually support
[1:10:56] a lot of other form factors too like you
[1:10:58] know, we have like iOS and Android apps.
[1:10:59] We have a desktop app. There's uh you
[1:11:01] know the Slack integration. There's all
[1:11:03] sorts of things that we support. So I
[1:11:05] would just like play around with these.
[1:11:06] And again it's like every engineer is
[1:11:07] different. Everyone that's building is
[1:11:08] different. Just find the thing that
[1:11:10] feels right to you and and use that. You
[1:11:12] don't have to use a terminal. It's the
[1:11:13] same quad agent running everywhere.
[1:11:15] >> Amazing. Okay. Just a couple more
[1:11:17] questions to round things out. What's
[1:11:20] your take on Codeex? How do you feel
[1:11:23] about that product? How do you feel
[1:11:24] about where they're going? Just kind of
[1:11:25] competing in this very competitive space
[1:11:28] uh in coding agents. Yeah, I actually
[1:11:31] haven't really used it, but uh I I think
[1:11:34] I did use it maybe when it came out. It
[1:11:36] looked a lot like Quad Code to me, so
[1:11:38] that was kind of flattering. It's I
[1:11:40] think it's actually good, you know, to
[1:11:41] have more competition cuz people should
[1:11:43] get to choose and hopefully it forces
[1:11:45] all of us to like do a even better job.
[1:11:48] Honestly, for our team though, we're
[1:11:50] just focused on solving the problems
[1:11:52] that users have. Um so for us, you know,
[1:11:55] we don't spend a lot of time looking at
[1:11:56] competing products. We don't really try
[1:11:58] the other products. I you know you kind
[1:12:00] of you want to be aware of them. You
[1:12:01] want to know they exist but for me I
[1:12:04] just I love talking to users. I love
[1:12:05] making the product better. Um I I love
[1:12:08] just acting on on feedback. So it's
[1:12:10] really just about building a building a
[1:12:12] good product.
[1:12:13] >> Maybe a last question. So I talked to
[1:12:15] Ben man co-founder of Anthropic. What
[1:12:17] what to talk to you about. He had a
[1:12:18] bunch of suggestions which I've
[1:12:19] integrated throughout our chat. One
[1:12:21] question he had for you is what's your
[1:12:23] plan post AGI?
[1:12:26] What do you think you're going to be
[1:12:26] doing? What's your life like once we hit
[1:12:28] AGI? whatever that means.
[1:12:30] >> So before I joined Anthropic, um I was
[1:12:33] actually living in rural Japan and it
[1:12:35] was like a totally different lifestyle.
[1:12:37] Um I was like the only engineer in the
[1:12:39] town. I was the only English speaker in
[1:12:40] the town. It was just like a totally
[1:12:42] different vibe. Like a couple times a
[1:12:45] week I would like bike to the farmers
[1:12:46] market. Uh and you know you like bike by
[1:12:49] like rice patties and stuff. It was just
[1:12:51] like a totally different speed than just
[1:12:53] complete opposite of San Francisco. One
[1:12:55] of the things that I really liked is a
[1:12:57] way that we got to know our neighbors
[1:12:59] and we kind of built friendships is by
[1:13:01] trading like pickles.
[1:13:03] So in that in the town where we lived,
[1:13:05] it was actually like everyone made like
[1:13:06] miso. Everyone made pickles. Uh and so I
[1:13:09] actually got like decently good at
[1:13:10] making miso. Um and you know I made a
[1:13:13] bunch of batches and um this is
[1:13:15] something that I still make. Uh miso is
[1:13:18] this interesting thing where it teaches
[1:13:20] you to think on these longtime skills.
[1:13:21] That's just very different than
[1:13:22] engineering cuz like uh you know like a
[1:13:24] batch of white miso takes like at least
[1:13:26] three months to make and a red miso is
[1:13:28] like you know 2 3 4 years. You just have
[1:13:30] to be very patient. You kind of mix it
[1:13:32] up and then you just like wet it sit.
[1:13:33] You have to be very very patient.
[1:13:35] >> So I the thing that I love about it is
[1:13:37] just thinking in these longtime skills.
[1:13:39] Uh, and yeah, I think postGI or if I
[1:13:42] wasn't at anthropic, I'd probably be
[1:13:44] making miso.
[1:13:46] >> I love this answer. Uh, Ben asked me to
[1:13:49] ask you about what's the deal with you
[1:13:50] and miso and so I love that you answered
[1:13:53] it. Okay, so the future the future might
[1:13:56] be just going deep into miso, getting
[1:13:59] really good at get making miso. Uh,
[1:14:02] amazing. Uh, Boris, this was incredible.
[1:14:05] I feel like we're we're brothers now
[1:14:06] from Ukraine. Uh before we get to a very
[1:14:09] exciting lightning round, is there
[1:14:10] anything else that you wanted to share?
[1:14:12] Is there anything you want to leave
[1:14:14] listeners with? Anything you want uh you
[1:14:16] want to double down on?
[1:14:18] >> Yeah, I I think I would just like
[1:14:19] underscore, you know, like for for
[1:14:22] anthropic since the beginning, this idea
[1:14:24] of like starting at coding, then getting
[1:14:26] to tool use, then getting to computer
[1:14:27] use has just been the way that we think
[1:14:29] about things. And we this is the way
[1:14:31] that we know the models are going to
[1:14:32] develop or, you know, the way that we
[1:14:34] want to build our models. And it's also
[1:14:36] the way that we get to learn about
[1:14:38] safety, study it, and improve it the
[1:14:39] most. So, you know, everything that's
[1:14:42] happening right now around, you know,
[1:14:43] just like Quad Code becoming this huge,
[1:14:46] you know, multi-billion dollar business
[1:14:48] and, you know, like now all of my
[1:14:50] friends use Quad Code and they just text
[1:14:51] me about it all the time. Uh, so just
[1:14:53] like, you know, this thing getting kind
[1:14:55] of big and in some ways it's a total
[1:14:56] surprise because this isn't kind of the
[1:15:00] we didn't know that it would be this
[1:15:01] product. We didn't know that it would
[1:15:02] start in a terminal or anything like
[1:15:04] this. But in some ways, it's just
[1:15:05] totally unsurprising because this has
[1:15:07] been our belief as a company for for a
[1:15:09] long time. At the same time, it just
[1:15:11] feels still very early, you know, like
[1:15:13] most of the world still does not use
[1:15:14] quad code. Most of the world still does
[1:15:16] not use AI. So, it just feels like this
[1:15:18] is 1% done and there's so much more to
[1:15:20] go.
[1:15:21] >> Yeah. Man, that's insane to think seeing
[1:15:23] the numbers that are coming out. You
[1:15:25] guys just raised a bazillion dollars. Uh
[1:15:27] I think Cloud Code alone is making$2
[1:15:30] billion dollars in revenue. you think
[1:15:32] Anthropic, I think the number you guys
[1:15:33] put out, you're making 15 billion in
[1:15:35] revenue. It's uh insane to just think
[1:15:38] this is how early it still is and just
[1:15:40] the numbers we're seeing.
[1:15:42] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. And and I
[1:15:44] mean like the the way that Quad Code has
[1:15:46] kept growing is honestly just the users.
[1:15:47] Like we so many people use it. They're
[1:15:49] so passionate about it. They fall in
[1:15:51] love with the product and then they tell
[1:15:52] us about stuff that doesn't work, stuff
[1:15:54] that they want. And so like the only
[1:15:56] reason that it keeps improving is
[1:15:57] because everyone is using it. Everyone
[1:15:59] is talking about it. Everyone keeps
[1:16:00] giving feedback and this is just the
[1:16:02] single most important thing and you know
[1:16:04] for me this is the way that I love to
[1:16:06] spend my day is just talking to users
[1:16:07] and making it better for them
[1:16:09] >> and making me so
[1:16:11] >> and making me so well the you know the
[1:16:13] miso is like not super involved it just
[1:16:14] you just got to wait you just got to
[1:16:16] wait
[1:16:17] >> well Boris with that we've reached our
[1:16:19] very exciting lightning round I've got
[1:16:21] five questions for you are you ready
[1:16:23] >> let's do it first question what are two
[1:16:26] or three books that you find yourself
[1:16:27] recommending most to other people
[1:16:29] >> I I'm a greeter. Uh I would start with
[1:16:31] the technical book one is it it is
[1:16:33] functional programming in Scola. This is
[1:16:36] the single best technical book I've ever
[1:16:37] read. It's very weird because you're
[1:16:40] probably not going to use Scola and I
[1:16:41] don't know how much this matters in the
[1:16:42] future now but there's this just
[1:16:44] elegance to functional programming and
[1:16:46] thinking in types and this is just the
[1:16:48] way that I code and the way that I can't
[1:16:50] stop thinking about coding. So you know
[1:16:52] you could think of it as a historical
[1:16:53] artifact. You could think of it as
[1:16:54] something that will level you up.
[1:16:56] >> I love this neverbeforementioned book.
[1:16:58] My favorite.
[1:16:59] >> Oh, amazing. Amazing. Uh, okay. Second
[1:17:02] one is uh Accelerondo by Straws. This is
[1:17:05] probably, you know, like my my big genre
[1:17:07] is uh is sci-fi. Uh like probably sci-fi
[1:17:10] and fiction. Accelerondo is just this
[1:17:12] incredible book and it it it's just so
[1:17:14] fast-paced. The pace gets faster and
[1:17:16] faster and faster. And I just feel like
[1:17:17] it captures the essence of this moment
[1:17:19] that we're in more than any other book
[1:17:21] that I've read. Just the speed of it.
[1:17:23] And it starts as a liftoff is starting
[1:17:26] to happen and you know starting to
[1:17:27] approach the singularity and it ends
[1:17:30] with like this like collective lobster
[1:17:31] consciousness orbiting Jupiter. Um and
[1:17:34] you know this happens over like the span
[1:17:36] of a few decades or something. So the
[1:17:38] the pace is just incredible. I I really
[1:17:40] love it. Maybe I'll I'll do one more
[1:17:42] book. Uh the wandering earth uh
[1:17:45] wandering earth by uh sishlu. So he's
[1:17:48] the guy that did uh three body problem.
[1:17:50] I think a lot of people know him for
[1:17:52] that. I actually I think your body
[1:17:53] problem was awesome, but I actually
[1:17:54] liked his short stories even more. So,
[1:17:56] Wandering Earth is one of the short
[1:17:58] story collections and it just has some
[1:17:59] really really amazing stories and it
[1:18:02] it's also just quite interesting to see
[1:18:04] uh Chinese sci-fi because it has a very
[1:18:06] different perspective than Western
[1:18:08] sci-fi and kind of the way that um at
[1:18:10] least he as a writer thinks about it.
[1:18:11] So, it's just really really interesting
[1:18:13] to read and just beautifully written.
[1:18:15] It's so interesting how sci-fi has
[1:18:16] prepared us to think about where things
[1:18:18] are going. Just like it creates these
[1:18:21] mounts to models of like okay I see I've
[1:18:23] read about this sort of world. Yeah. I
[1:18:24] think I think for me this is like the
[1:18:26] reason that I joined anthropic actually
[1:18:28] cuz uh you know like like I said I was
[1:18:30] living in this rural place. I was
[1:18:32] thinking these longtime skills because
[1:18:34] everything is just so slow out there at
[1:18:36] least compared to SF. Um and just like
[1:18:38] all the things that you do are based
[1:18:39] around the seasons and it's based around
[1:18:41] this food that takes many many months.
[1:18:43] That's the way that kind of like social
[1:18:44] events are organized. That's the way you
[1:18:46] kind of organize your time. You like you
[1:18:48] go to the farmers market and it's like
[1:18:50] it's pimmen season and you know that
[1:18:52] because there's like 20 pimmen vendors
[1:18:54] and then the next week the season is
[1:18:55] done and it's like grape season and you
[1:18:57] kind of see this. So it's like these
[1:18:58] kind of longtime skills and I was also
[1:19:00] reading a bunch of sci-fi at the time
[1:19:02] and just like being in this moment I was
[1:19:04] like you know just thinking about these
[1:19:05] long time scales. I know how this thing
[1:19:07] can go and I just I felt like I had to
[1:19:09] contribute to it going a little bit
[1:19:11] better and that's actually why I ended
[1:19:13] up at Ant and Ben man was also a big
[1:19:15] part of that too.
[1:19:16] >> I feel like I want to do a whole podcast
[1:19:18] just talking about your time in Japan
[1:19:20] and the journey of Boris through Japan
[1:19:23] to anthropic but we'll keep it we'll
[1:19:25] keep it short. Uh I'll quickly recommend
[1:19:27] a sci-fi book to you if you haven't read
[1:19:28] it. Have you read Fire Upon the Deep?
[1:19:31] >> Uh this is Ving, right? Yeah. It's
[1:19:33] great.
[1:19:34] >> Yes. Okay. That one's like it's like so
[1:19:36] interesting from a AI AGI perspective.
[1:19:39] Uh so few people have read that so um I
[1:19:42] myself
[1:19:43] >> Yeah. It's like a lot.
[1:19:46] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like Deepness in the
[1:19:47] Sky also. I think those sequels, right?
[1:19:50] Or
[1:19:50] >> Yeah.
[1:19:50] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
[1:19:52] >> Yeah. It's very long and like complex to
[1:19:53] get into but so good. Okay. We'll keep
[1:19:55] going through a lightning round. Uh do
[1:19:56] you have a favorite recent movie or TV
[1:19:58] show you really enjoyed?
[1:19:59] >> So, I actually don't really watch TV or
[1:20:01] movies. I just don't really have time
[1:20:03] these days. Um, I did watch I I I'm
[1:20:05] going to bring up another sishloo, but
[1:20:07] the three body problem series on Netflix
[1:20:09] I I really loved. Um, I thought that was
[1:20:11] like a great rendition of the book
[1:20:12] series.
[1:20:12] >> So, the common pattern across uh AI
[1:20:14] leaders is no time to watch TV or
[1:20:16] movies, which I completely understand.
[1:20:19] Uh, is there a favorite product you've
[1:20:20] recently discovered that you really
[1:20:21] love?
[1:20:22] >> I'm going to like chill a little bit and
[1:20:24] just say co-work cuz this is
[1:20:27] legitimately the the one product that's
[1:20:28] been pretty life-changing for me. uh
[1:20:30] just because I I have it running all the
[1:20:32] time and uh the the Chrome integration
[1:20:34] in particular is just really excellent.
[1:20:36] Uh so it's been like it paid a traffic
[1:20:38] fine for me. It like canceled a couple
[1:20:40] subscriptions for me. Uh just like the
[1:20:42] amount of like tedious work it gets out
[1:20:43] of the way is awesome. I I also don't
[1:20:45] know if it's a product, but maybe I'll
[1:20:46] I'll uh also another podcast that I
[1:20:48] really love obviously besides uh besides
[1:20:50] Venny is
[1:20:51] >> obviously
[1:20:52] >> Yeah, it's uh it's the acquired uh
[1:20:55] podcast by Ben Ben and David.
[1:20:57] >> Uh it's it's just like super it's super
[1:20:59] awesome. Um, I feel like the way that
[1:21:00] they get into like business history and
[1:21:02] bring it alive is is really really good.
[1:21:04] And I would start with a Nintendo
[1:21:06] episode if uh if you haven't listened to
[1:21:08] it.
[1:21:08] >> Great tip uh with co-work just so people
[1:21:11] understand if they haven't tried this
[1:21:12] like basically you type something you
[1:21:14] want to get done and it can launch
[1:21:17] Chrome and just do things for you. I saw
[1:21:19] one of the someone went on pat leave
[1:21:21] from anthropic and he had it fill out
[1:21:23] these like medical forms for him. these
[1:21:25] like really annoying PDFs where it just
[1:21:27] like loads up the browser, logs in,
[1:21:28] fills them out, and bits them.
[1:21:30] >> Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And and it
[1:21:31] actually just kind of works. Like we
[1:21:32] tried this experiment like a year ago
[1:21:34] and it didn't really work cuz the model
[1:21:35] wasn't ready, but now now it actually
[1:21:37] just works. And it's amazing. I think a
[1:21:39] lot of people just don't really
[1:21:40] understand what this is because they
[1:21:42] haven't used agent before. And it it
[1:21:45] just feels very very similar to me to
[1:21:47] quad code a year ago. Um but like I
[1:21:49] said, it's just growing much faster than
[1:21:50] quad code did in the early days. So, I
[1:21:53] think it's starting to it's starting to
[1:21:54] break through a bit.
[1:21:55] >> And there's also this Chrome extension
[1:21:56] that you mentioned that you could just
[1:21:57] use stand alone that sits in Chrome and
[1:21:59] you could just talk to Claude uh looking
[1:22:02] at your screen at your browser and have
[1:22:04] it do stuff, have it tell you about what
[1:22:06] you're looking at, summarize what you're
[1:22:07] looking at, things like that.
[1:22:08] >> Exactly. Exactly. For for people that
[1:22:10] are like just starting to use co-work,
[1:22:11] the thing I recommend is so you download
[1:22:13] the Quad Desktop app, you go to the
[1:22:14] co-work tab. It's right next to the code
[1:22:16] tab. Um the thing that I recommend doing
[1:22:18] is like start by having it use a tool.
[1:22:20] So like clean up your desktop or like
[1:22:22] summarize your email or something like
[1:22:24] this or you know like respond to the top
[1:22:25] three emails like it actually just
[1:22:27] responds to emails for me now too. The
[1:22:29] second thing is connect tools. So like
[1:22:31] if you connect like if you say look at
[1:22:33] my top emails and then send slack
[1:22:35] messages or you know like put them in a
[1:22:36] spreadsheet or something or for example
[1:22:38] like I use it for all my project
[1:22:39] management. So we have a single
[1:22:40] spreadsheet for the whole team. there's
[1:22:42] like a row per engineer. Every week
[1:22:44] everyone fills out a status and every
[1:22:46] Monday co-work just goes through and it
[1:22:47] messages every engineer on Slack that
[1:22:49] hasn't filled out their status and so I
[1:22:51] don't have to do this anymore. And this
[1:22:52] is just one prompt. It'll do everything.
[1:22:54] And then the third thing is just run a
[1:22:56] bunch of quads in parallel. So we can
[1:22:58] co-work you can have as many tasks
[1:22:59] running as you want. So it's like start
[1:23:01] one task, you know, I have this project
[1:23:02] management thing running, then I'll have
[1:23:04] it do something else, then something
[1:23:05] else and I'll kick these off and then I
[1:23:07] just go get a coffee while it runs.
[1:23:09] There's a post I'll link to that shares
[1:23:11] a bunch of ways people use uh what was
[1:23:14] previously cloud code and now just you
[1:23:16] could do through code work because a lot
[1:23:17] of this is just like oh wow I hadn't
[1:23:18] thought I could use it for that and once
[1:23:20] you see like these examples I think are
[1:23:22] what people need to hear of just like oh
[1:23:24] wow I didn't know I could do that
[1:23:26] >> so
[1:23:26] >> yeah I think a lot of this was also
[1:23:28] >> some of this was also inspired by you
[1:23:30] any
[1:23:31] >> you you had this post about uh it was
[1:23:32] like 50 non-technical use cases for
[1:23:34] quote or something like this
[1:23:36] >> so we actually one of our PMs used that
[1:23:38] as a way to evaluate co-work before we
[1:23:40] released it. Um, and I think at the
[1:23:42] point where we hit where Coowork was
[1:23:43] able to do like 48 out of the 50, they
[1:23:45] were like, "Okay, it's pretty good."
[1:23:46] >> Wow. I did not know that. That is
[1:23:49] awesome. Uh, it's I've become an eval.
[1:23:53] >> Yeah. How does that feel?
[1:23:55] >> Amazing.
[1:23:57] I feel like I'm valuable to the future
[1:23:59] of AI.
[1:24:01] >> This is like reverse breaking through.
[1:24:05] >> Wow, that is so cool. Wow. Okay. I
[1:24:06] wonder what those last two are. Anyway,
[1:24:08] okay, two more questions. Um, do you
[1:24:10] have a favorite life motto that you
[1:24:12] often come back to in work or in life?
[1:24:14] >> Use common sense.
[1:24:16] I think a lot of the failures that I see
[1:24:18] in especially in a work environment is
[1:24:20] people just failing to use common sense.
[1:24:22] Like they follow a process without
[1:24:23] thinking about it. Um, they just do a
[1:24:25] thing without thinking about it or
[1:24:26] they're working on a product that's like
[1:24:27] not a good product or not a good idea
[1:24:29] and they're just following the momentum
[1:24:30] and not thinking about it. I think the
[1:24:32] best results that I see are people
[1:24:33] thinking from first principles and just
[1:24:35] developing their own common sense. Like
[1:24:37] if something smells weird, then you know
[1:24:39] it's probably not a good idea. So I
[1:24:41] think I think just this this is the
[1:24:43] single advice that I give, you know, to
[1:24:44] co-workers more more than anything too.
[1:24:46] And
[1:24:46] >> I feel like that alone could be its own
[1:24:48] podcast conversation. What is common
[1:24:50] sense? How do you build? But we'll keep
[1:24:52] this short. Uh final question. Uh so
[1:24:54] you've been got more active on Twitterx.
[1:24:57] I'm curious just uh why and just what's
[1:25:00] your experience been with with Twitter,
[1:25:01] the world of Twitter? Uh because you get
[1:25:03] a lot of engagement on on Twitterx.
[1:25:06] >> So for a long time I used Threads
[1:25:08] exclusively because I actually helped
[1:25:10] build threads a little bit back in the
[1:25:11] day. Um and I also just like the design.
[1:25:13] It's like a very clean product. I I just
[1:25:15] really like that.
[1:25:17] >> I started using Threads cuz actually I
[1:25:18] was bored. Um so in in December I was in
[1:25:21] Europe.
[1:25:21] >> You started using Twitter, you mean?
[1:25:23] >> Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I started I started
[1:25:24] using uh Twitter because I was bored. So
[1:25:26] my my wife and I were uh we were
[1:25:27] traveling around in in Europe for
[1:25:29] December. We're just kind of nomading
[1:25:30] around. We went to like Copenhagen, went
[1:25:32] to like a few different countries. Um
[1:25:34] and for me it was just like a coding
[1:25:36] vacation. So every day I was coding and
[1:25:38] that's like my favorite kind of vacation
[1:25:40] just to just like code all day. It's the
[1:25:42] best. And at some point I just kind of
[1:25:44] got bored and like I ran out of ideas
[1:25:46] for you know like a few hours. I was
[1:25:48] like okay what do I want to do next? And
[1:25:49] so I opened Twitter. I saw some people
[1:25:51] like tweeting about quad code and then I
[1:25:53] just started responding and then I was
[1:25:55] like okay maybe actually I think I
[1:25:57] should do is just like look for people
[1:25:59] look for bugs that people have maybe
[1:26:01] people have like bugs or kind of
[1:26:02] feedback they have and so kind of
[1:26:04] introduce myself ask for if people had a
[1:26:05] bunch of bugs and feedback and I think
[1:26:08] they were kind of surprised by like the
[1:26:09] pace at which we're able to address
[1:26:11] feedback nowadays. Um, for me it's just
[1:26:14] like so normal like if someone has a bug
[1:26:16] like I can probably fix it within a few
[1:26:17] minutes because I just sort of quad and
[1:26:19] as long as the description is good it'll
[1:26:21] just go and do it and then I'll I'll go
[1:26:23] do something else and answer the next
[1:26:24] thing. But I think for a lot of people
[1:26:26] was pretty surprising. So that was
[1:26:27] really cool and yeah the experience on
[1:26:29] Twitter has been pretty great. It's it's
[1:26:31] been awesome just engaging with people
[1:26:32] and seeing what people want uh hearing
[1:26:35] hearing about bugs, hearing about
[1:26:37] features. I saw complaints to Nikita
[1:26:39] Beer the other day on Twitter of just
[1:26:41] you they're like posting many threads
[1:26:42] and it was breaking and just like oh man
[1:26:44] what's going on here.
[1:26:45] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There there was a bug.
[1:26:47] I hope it's fixed now. Amazing. Oh man,
